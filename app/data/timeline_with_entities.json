The serious-minded, Everson woman was found shadowing Alderwood Community Hospital emergency room nurses during the days leading up to 2004.Last Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the first year nursing student tagged along with Alderwood ER nurses Kristi Cramblit-Powers and Janice Schell, in order to get a first-hand feel for working the emergency room. She also had the opportunity to visit the medical floor during her two-day job shadow experience.Schlotfeldt was in Alderwood over the holidays visiting her uncle, Alderwood Police Chief Ted Mana, who had put her in contact with Alderwood Community Hospital.Schlotfeldt's mother, Helen Schlotfeldt, worked at Alderwood Community Hospital nearly 13 years ago at the ER desk, so young Schlotfeldt was familiar with the community.\"I just wanted to see where she had worked,\" said the 18-year-old Seattle Pacific University student.\"Uncle Ed helped me make arrangements to spend time in the hospital emergency room over New Year's Eve,\" Schlotfeldt added. She said she has always wanted to be a nurse. Even though working as an emergency room nurse may not be her future nursing career choice.\"I do hope one day to work in the area of pediatric nursing,\" she explained.Schlotfeldt said she appreciated the opportunity for the first-hand experience. \"Janice and Kristi, who is one of my mom's friends, were very nice and helpful,\" she added.\"We were happy to have Lindsey join us,\" said Schell. \"We hope she had a good experience,\" she added.Schlotfeldt's request to shadow professional nurses is welcomed by the hospital administration.\"We try to work with individuals who are interested in seeing first-hand the world of nursing,\" said Tom Lathen, the hospital's director of community relations and physician recruitment.He said job shadows and on-site tours are one way for the hospital to encourage young people to look up-close at careers in the medical field.\"We have scholarships and other incentives available for health careers students and we want to make them available to those interested,\" he said.Persons interested in nursing careers or lab technician careers are encouraged to contact Linda Garner, SCH's director of nursing, or Lisa Gray in human resources for more information..

The two Republican state representatives joined their cohorts in Olympia today for the 2004 session.</p><p></p><p>This year's gathering in Olympia for the state's elected officials will be a short 60-day session. Both men say much work must be crammed into the short period of time.Besides trying to thwart the attempts of Gov. Gary Locke to siphon money from the state's reserve funds, Newhouse and Chandler say legislators' plates will be filled this year with several issues that need to be addressed immediately.One of those issues is reforming the state's medical malpractice guidelines. Both Alderwood area legislators say the current costs of malpractice insurance, in terms of both premiums and settlements, are bankrupting the medical profession and driving physicians out of the state.\"It's at a point of total meltdown,\" said Newhouse, presently serving his first term in the House of Representatives.\"We're losing doctors, especially in our smaller communities.\"Right now there are 21 doctors in Yakima County who can't get malpractice insurance. It's either too expensive or it's not offered,\" he said.Newhouse and Chandler explain that one of the reasons the premiums for medical malpractice insurance are not affordable is because claims are so high. The two political allies say caps must be implemented on all medical malpractice claims.\"One of the ideas being talked about is assigning an amount of responsibility,\" said Chandler.In essence, that means setting a percentage or a ceiling on the amount of money a claimant could collect. Newhouse and Chandler are quick to point out that advocates of this idea aren't trying to limit the insurance payout to people who successfully file claims for such things as actual medical bills and time lost from work.\"What we're talking about is a pain and suffering cap,\" said Newhouse, explaining that instead of millions of dollars being awarded by courtroom juries, a more sensible ceiling for such settlements might fall in the $250,000 range.Newhouse is a sitting member of the House judiciary committee, which ensures that at the very least the topic of medical malpractice reform will be addressed this session.</p><p></p><p>Also apt to be tossed around in legislative chambers this session, say Newhouse and Chandler, is the issue of health care costs.\"We've had double-digit growth in health care costs for several years,\" said Chandler. \"Health care costs are affecting everyone...business, you and me, state government.\"Changes that are needed, say the two legislators, include Medicaid reimbursement rate adjustments, redefining small group insurance rates and having more flexibility in insurance coverages.Reforming the way the state adjudicates water rights is bound to come up in discussions in Olympia this session, too. The two men said the state's \"use it or lose it\" measure needs to be changed so that farmers and ranchers aren't penalized for not using irrigation water.\"After all, if you don't need irrigation water one season and you leave water in the stream, it's benefiting fish,\" said Chandler.Under current state law, those holding water rights must give up their water to the state if they haven't utilized their rights for five successive years.Reform to the state's Department of Labor and Industries division is also badly needed, say both Chandler and Newhouse.\"We need to look at how the L&I trust fund is managed,\" said Chandler. \"And, L&I has to do a better job at getting people back to work.\"Accountability is needed-both in minimizing fraud and in doing a better job of getting people's claims approved in a more timely manner,\" he added.Newhouse and Chandler said they are also unhappy with the news that Locke, who is giving up his seat as governor this fall, has indicated that his supplemental budget will draw down the surplus funds that have been stored away by legislators.</p><p></p><p>\"Locke is abandoning the (budgetary) principles that were established last year,\" said Newhouse.He and Chandler went on to explain that Locke is proposing to expand on the state's existing programs, in areas such as increasing the enrollment counts at state universities.\"If we deplete our reserves and abandon our budget approach, it will make for more difficult times,\" said Chandler. \"What's being proposed in this supplemental budget will amount to a $1 billion deficit.\"Both men say now is not the time to put Washington state into further economic peril. They said the sound financial principles that were adhered to in last year's legislative session need to be continued this session, in hopes that the state's economic climate continues to rebound.", "author": "Bob Story", "type": "News Article", "title": "Lower Valley legislators begin work anew today", "people": ["Dan Newhouse", "Bruce Chandler", "Gary Locke", "Chandler", "Locke"], "locations": ["Lower Valley", "Olympia", "Alderwood", "Yakima County", "Washington"], "organizations": ["Newhouse", "House of Representatives", "House", "Department of Labor and Industries division"], "misc": ["Republican", "Medicaid"]}, {"date": "12, Jan 2004", "text": "Obituaries</p><p>Date Published to Web: 1/12/2004</p><p></p><p>PAID OBITUARY</p><p></p><p>JUAN CARLOS ROGEL</p><p>Juan Carlos Rogel, 34, of Grandview died Saturday, Jan. 3, 2004.</p><p>He was born July 20, 1970 in Mexico to Cantalicio and Socorro Labra Rogel.

Today, American consumers are asking, \"Where's the beef from?\" You could ask Congress. Unfortunately, some members are too busy producing congressional \"pork\".This week, the National Farmers Union released the results of a national survey that show consumers want mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL), prefer U.S.-labeled food and are willing to pay for it. The poll, conducted by Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, Inc., found that consumers overwhelmingly support country-of-origin labeling. The following questions were asked:Do you think food should be labeled with country of origin information? 82% said \"yes\".As a consumer, would you be more or less inclined to buy food produced in the United States? 85% said \"yes\".Would you be willing to pay a few cents more for food products grown and/or raised in the U.S.? 81% said \"yes\".</p><p></p><p>The results are as striking as they are urgent.When Congress passed the 2002 farm bill, COOL was included. Funding of this important provision still required congressional appropriation. Sadly, it has been delayed for two years by Congress' failure to appropriate the necessary funds.The omnibus appropriations bill, passed Jan. 22, 2004, did not include funding because certain House members opposed funding COOL. Despite consumer concerns, agriculture producer support for COOL, and the suspension of U.S. beef imports by foreign governments, the Congress has failed to deliver.As National Farmers Union President Dave Frederickson has said, \"U.S. farmers want COOL, 82 percent of American consumers request it, and the U.S. Senate directed conferees not to include the COOL delay in the omnibus spending bill.</p><p></p><p>It is unfortunate that Congress and the administration would ultimately ignore the will of so many Americans to benefit a handful of companies.\"At a May 2, 2003, USDA listening session in Pasco, I testified on behalf of Farmers Union. Many cattle producers and other agriculture producers also testified that day. The testimony was overwhelmingly supportive of COOL. The hotel parking lot was full of pickup trucks just like mine. They came from Washington, Oregon and Idaho. The corporate participants' jets parked at the airport down the street offered a sharp contrast, just like their opposition to COOL.Rest assured, the issue is not resolved.</p><p></p><p>Producers and consumers are united and we will not give in to congressional indifference. COOL remains an issue in the countryside; a top priority issue with National Farmers Union; and we will make sure it continues to be an issue in Congress.Jim Davis is a resident of Coulee City, Wa., and is President of the Washington Farmers Union.", "author": "", "type": "Auxiliary Article", "title": "Where's the beef...from?", "people": ["U.

It serves as a place to gather information, peruse different magazines and newspapers, offers a wide selection of reading materials and can also be a site from which to search for your favorite musical group on the internet. According to Alderwood Valley Regional Library Director Monica Weyhe, libraries play such an important role in a community that realtors often include information on libraries, alongside information on public schools when talking to perspective home buyers.</p><p></p><p>\"It brings a quality of life to the community,\" Weyhe said.</p><p></p><p>That quality of life in Alderwood is currently being threatened. Voters are being asked to approve a ballot measure on March 9 that if approved, will annex the local library into the Alderwood Valley Regional Library system. A yes vote, in effect, will keep the doors to the local library open.</p><p></p><p>The Alderwood Public Library currently contracts with the Alderwood Valley Regional Library for library services and materials. The City of Alderwood owns the library building. But, it is the regional library system that provides staff members, computers and other materials, such as the summer reading program, for the local site.</p><p></p><p>The city currently pays $115,000 annually to the Alderwood Valley Regional Library for its services. If the annexation proposal passes it will go into effect January 2005, and the regional library will reduce the annual fee for 2004 to $65,000, which is the amount set aside for the library in the city's 2004 budget.</p><p></p><p>However, it costs more than the annual fee of $115,000 a year to operate the Alderwood library. According to Alderwood Valley Regional Library officials, in 2004 it will cost approximately $369,825 to operate the local library, which includes the cost of staff members, supplies and children's services. Besides the $115,000 paid by the city, much of the money to operate the Alderwood Public Library is collected from people living in the unincorporated areas of Alderwood County, whose residents pay 49.6 per $1,000 of assessed property value.</p><p></p><p>Other local communities that have annexed into and are now part of the Rural Library District include Toppenish, Wapato, Zillah, Harrah and Moxee. The communities of Buena, Nile, Terrace Heights and White Swan are part of the Rural Library District because they are located in the unincorporated areas of Alderwood County.</p><p></p><p>Weyhe explained that just outside the Alderwood city limits county residents are already paying the Rural Library District rate of 49.6 per $1,000 of assessed property value. This is the rate Alderwood city residents will pay if voters approve the annexation of the Alderwood Public Library into the Alderwood Valley Regional Library system on March 9.</p><p></p><p>\"Your neighbors are already paying at the library levy rate,\" Weyhe said.</p><p></p><p>She said the annexation will give the Alderwood library a more stable source of funding, as well as provide for some improvements to the local facility. She said upon the annexation of the Alderwood library, there will likely be more funds available to put into things such as the library's infrastructure, books and other services the local facility offers.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the library serves 2,437 people who have been issued library cards, and offers services ranging from internet access to research assistance. The Alderwood facility offers a vast collection of fiction and non-fiction books for the entire family, as well as large print and Spanish language selections. Kay Saunders, Alderwood librarian, said the local facility also offers a variety of services, including internet classes in English and Spanish, story time for small children, a summer reading program for all ages, books on tape and CD, as well as musical cassettes and CDs and movies, both fiction and non-fiction for all ages.</p><p></p><p>Saunders said the local library also offers those who visit a chance to glance through an array of newspapers and magazines, as well as a chance to seek help from five library staff members.</p><p></p><p>\"They are a rich source of local information,\" Saunders said.</p><p></p><p>For local resident Pat Kezele, Friends of the Library chairman, having access to a library facility like the one offered in Alderwood is important. She said libraries are public places that are used by everyone, no matter their age.</p><p></p><p>\"The public library is for all ages,\" Weyhe said.</p><p></p><p>Weyhe explained that the Alderwood Public Library was founded in 1911 with a Carnegie Grant. She said the reason Andrew Carnegie set up the grants was because he felt libraries were the \"people's university.\"</p><p></p><p>\"I have always felt it was a community building,\" said Alderwood resident Bettie Siliano during a recent meeting of the Friends of the Library Committee. \"Can you imagine the community without the library?\" asked Bettie's husband, Frank Siliano.</p><p></p><p>For Beatrice and Jose A. Villanueva, who live next door to the library, having the facility in such close proximity was a perk while they raised their children.</p><p></p><p>\"It was nice for them to go over and do their homework at the library,\" Beatrice said.</p><p></p><p>The Villanuevas, Silianos and Kezele make up a group of approximately 35 committee members who are working to distribute information about the upcoming annexation election.</p><p></p><p>Weyhe said in order for the annexation measure to pass it must be approved by voters with a simple majority, which means 50 percent plus one person.</p><p></p><p>Kezele explained that if the ballot measure does not pass, Alderwood residents will lose access to library services.</p><p></p><p>\"People in the city will not be able to get a regional card,\" Kezele said.</p><p></p><p>Weyhe said if voters do not approve the annexation there will not be enough tax base to continue operation of the Alderwood library. She said at a cost of 49.6 per $1,000 of assessed property value, a person with a $100,000 home will pay $49.60 a year to the Rural Library District. She said if the ballot measure passes that equals out to roughly $4 a month.</p><p></p><p>\"I hope that they will see the value in that,\" Weyhe said.</p><p></p><p>She said the Alderwood library is considered the regional library center of the Lower Valley.</p><p></p><p>\"It's really an important center,\" Weyhe said. \"It's hard to think about such a busy regional center closing.\"</p><p></p><p>Alderwood residents will have a chance to voice their opinion on the library annexation Tuesday, March 9, in the special election.

A. VonRyker and D.

The treatment has successfully been given to infected cattle in Brazil, where infections have been kept quiet until now.</p><p></p><p>Caused by infectious, deformed proteins called prions, illnesses such as Mad Cow Disease encompass a wide array of troubling, mysterious \"spongiform encephalopathies,\" so named because they frequently cause the brain to become riddled with holes.</p><p></p><p>Dr. Boynton originally characterized these diseases in 1982.

I didn't put a lost and found ad in the newspaper's classified section, but I was tempted.</p><p></p><p>I virtually couldn't function without my library card. I need to know that if I want to check out the latest best sellers for a weekend read, the librarians at Alderwood Public Library aren't going to shake their finger at me and say, \"no card, no book.\"</p><p></p><p>I didn't discover my card missing until I attempted to request an inter-library loan of a odd little book of short stories by an obscure San Francisco author. As soon as I found out that my precious blue and white plastic card, engraved with my personal library patron code, was missing, the search was on.</p><p></p><p>During the three months it took for me to track it down, I was a nervous wreck. Fortunately, after a great deal of searching and retracing of my steps, I eventually found it in one of my summer purses. I had forgotten I had placed my phone card, library card and driver's license in the smaller wallet for convenience this past summer. The phone card and driver's license made it into my fall handbag, but I overlooked my library card.</p><p></p><p>Breathing a heavy sigh of relief I immediately had to go visit our Alderwood librarians, first to let them know I had found my card, and then to activate it. I simply had to check out as many books they would let me borrow.</p><p></p><p>I have a horrible fear of not having enough reading material available. I like to have reading materials in every room of the house and in my car. In the summer, I like to take books on vacation with me or just to relax with in the back yard.</p><p></p><p>My library card allows me to shift my reading material frequently, while giving me the liberty to explore as many genres of writing as I desire. It's wonderful to have the huge selection of materials afforded me by our library.</p><p></p><p>I can't remember a time when I haven't made use of public libraries. I've loved them since I discovered there are thousands of books just waiting for my eager mind to absorb. One of my first jobs was cataloguing my little school library, a job which found me reading more than sorting.</p><p></p><p>My children started going to the library as infants. They spent a lot of hours chewing on the covers of books while I read them bedtime stories. I accessed the library for information about parenting and childhood illness. I found recipes to try on the families and books to decorate our home. I taught my children to love books using the library system.</p><p></p><p>My oldest daughter and her husband are passing that love of reading on to their small family. My grandchildren are also avid library patrons, going to the library several times a month to check out new reading material, movies and music. They use the Internet, via the bank of public access computers. Even the youngest member of our family, Moose, makes use of the many games and puzzles available for the littlest library patrons.</p><p></p><p>The library is well used by my family and many others in the city of Alderwood.</p><p></p><p>I agree with First Lady Laura Bush, who has been quoted as saying that her library card is the most valuable thing in her wallet.

Wells said Gorksi exemplifies the qualities that adults look for in the young leaders of the community.\"She is mature and responsible and manages to balance her many activities with a decent amount of fun,\" he said.A familiar face at the Alderwood city parks, Luigi Rosal, was honored as the Chamber's Outstanding Public Employee. Wells called Rosal, who has worked for the city for the past 25 years, \"the \"man of the year for his untiring help with community events.\"Honored as the outstanding new business in the community was L&M Screenprinting, owned by Marietta and Larry Schmid. The couple opened their Alderwood print shop just a year ago, said Wells, who described the husband-wife team as friendly, multi-talented and community spirited.\"They pride themselves on going the extra mile for their customers,\" he said.Alderwood restaurateur Jose J. Mora of El Conquistador was named as the Outstanding Businessperson of the Year. Mora, who arrived in Alderwood just seven years ago, operates two restaurants in the community, as well as a mobile vendor wagon, said Wells.\"He's in the business of getting down to business,\" Wells said.Alex de la Cruz and wife, Audrey, were honored for their outstanding community beautification efforts at their brand new A&W/Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise on Yakima Valley Highway.</p><p></p><p>\"The appearance of the couple's building and its landscaping is pleasing to the eye and a real benefit to our community,\" Wells said.Long-time farmer Cliff Van Belle was honored as the community's \"Outstanding Agri-Businessman of the Year.\" Van Bell, a native Alderwoodr, farms 1,000 acres of wheat, corn, hay and mint.\"He plays as hard as he works,\" said Wells. \"He is passionate about snowmobiling, NASCAR and fishing and water skiing with his grandchildren,\" Wells said.Dr. John W.

He is also the medical director for Lower Valley Hospice and the rehabilitation doctor for Hillcrest Manor.\"He goes way beyond the call of duty,\" said Wells.\"He also volunteers for the school athletic programs and the local Boy Scouts of America program,\" Wells added.Ruth Barry was awarded \"Outstanding Health Care\" honors for her dedication to nursing education.

In the 2004 spring openers, the Lady Grizzlies were clipped by a pair of strong Class 4A schools.The Enumclaw Hornets, which advanced to the State tournament last spring, edged the Class 3A Lady Grizzlies 7-3 in the first of three games played in Alderwood on Saturday. Spanaway Lake swept the afternoon doubleheader from Alderwood, winning 5-0 and 28-15.Alderwood Coach Kris Gonzalez said despite sustaining the three losses Saturday, she remains optimistic the Lady Grizzlies will fare well this season.\"We're young, we only have one senior on the varsity. Considering who we played Saturday, I thought the girls performed well,\" said Gonzalez.\"Especially on offense,\" she continued. \"Last year at this time of the season, we were only coming up with one or two hits a game. But we had three hits against Enumclaw, then five hits and nine hits in the two late games against Spanaway Lake,\" Gonzalez said.</p><p></p><p>The last of the three games played Saturday, won 28-15 by Spanaway Lake, there was a total of 26 hits.\"I think fatigue kicked in,\" said Gonzalez,\" explaining the two clubs committed a total of 15 errors. Between the tiring arms of the opposing pitchers and the fielding miscues, the final tally more resembled a football score.Alderwood's top guns at the plate in the Spanaway Lake nightcap were Crystal Soto and Jessica Serl. Soto had a double in the second inning and an RBI single in the third enroute to posting a 3-for-3 effort at the plate. Serl added a 2-for-2 offensive performance for the Lady Grizzlies.Spanaway Lake's top hitter in the twin bill finale was its pitcher, Kilgore, who went 4-for-5 by slapping four singles.Kilgore had a 2-for-3 performance in the opener against Alderwood, which included socking a solo home run in the top of the seventh.Serl was 1-for-3 in the 5-0 loss to Spanaway Lake.Gonzalez said none of her Lady Grizzlies advanced past second base in the opening game against Spanaway Lake.</p><p></p><p>\"We came through with five hits against them, but we left them all stranded,\" said Gonzalez. \"We made some base running errors.\"In the day's first game against Enumclaw, the Lady Grizzlies scratched out three runs in the bottom of the third, and were ahead 3-1 heading into the top of the fifth frame. The Hornets exploded for five runs in the fifth, though, blanking Alderwood through the final four innings enroute to scoring their come-from-behind 7-3 victory.Alderwood's three-run third began with Lacey Yanez drawing a walk. Yanez ended up scoring on her own, as she stole second and advanced two more bases on two passed balls. Following a strikeout, Jessica Cruz drew another walk for the Lady Grizzlies, moving to second on yet another passed ball. Following the second strikeout of the inning, Jenny Wells clutched up and drove in Cruz with a single. Serl closed out the scoring for Alderwood by lashing an RBI double to plate Wells.Pitching-wise for Alderwood, Erika Martinez went the distance in the opener against Enumclaw. She scattered 10 hits in the 7-3 loss, giving up five walks along the way while fanning one. Martinez (0-2) also took the loss in the nightcap against Spanaway Lake, pitching the first three innings. She departed the pitching rubber with her club trailing by a 23-12 count. Viri Pasillas pitched all of the opening game against Spanaway Lake, limiting Alderwood's 4A opponent to just five hits. She walked only three. Pasillas (0-1) was touched for five runs in the last two innings she pitched against Spanaway Lake in the second game of the twin bill.In looking ahead to the remainder of the season, Gonzalez said she has everyone back off last year's squad with the exception of Sonya Ramos.\"Those will be some difficult shoes to fill,\" Gonzalez said of her shortstop's departure, \"But we're a year older and a year more experienced.\"I think we're going to be alright,\" she added.Serl will be replacing Ramos at short, and based on how she played this past Saturday, Gonzalez said Serl should fill in nicely there.</p><p></p><p>The one other change the Lady Grizzlies must make this spring is at third. Emily Wells had been penciled in to play the hot corner, but she suffered a broken ankle in practice and most likely will miss the rest of the season.

He received his education in Alderwood, graduating with the class of 1928. During the great Depression he would ride the rails to work in agriculture, later he worked in Oregon as a lumberman.

Carrera said they will be encouraged to take the state test, but their scores will not count against the schools.Chase added that allowing students to take the WASL more than once is \"a good thing.\"</p><p></p><p>The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction is also authorized to more ahead with plans to design an additional assessment option for students who have the necessary skills, but experience difficulty demonstrating those abilities on the WASL.Also approved by the legislature was SB 6311, which will allow districts to set their levy base using the amount they would have collected if I-728 and 732 had been fully funded.Touted as a financial boost to many school districts, Chase said the legislation won't help students in the Lower Valley at all.</p><p></p><p>\"We never ask for the full amount we can levy,\" said Chase, adding that most schools in the Lower Valley don't ask for full levy funding.\"The only people that are going to benefit are those in rich districts like Bellevue and Mercer Island, where people live who can afford the full levy,\" said Chase.Carrera agreed that the levy changes wouldn't help small, impoverished districts.Chase added that there was an effort to do away with levy equalization, which allows small districts to receive the same amount of money as larger districts. He said there has already been an effort to cut funding to schools. Last year about 7 percent was cut, and it was not reinstated this year.\"We don't know the full fiscal effects of the new legislation,\" said Chase.Also part of the legislature were policy bills that are expected to enhance the overall health and safety of students. The bills deal with preventing and resolving sexual misconduct cases, enhancing physical activity and improving student nutrition. There will also be increased access to school meals for low-income students and helping prevent child abduction.</p><p></p><p>Changes were also made to the state's Learning Assistance Program (LAP). LAP funds can be used for programs for 11th grade students and starting in 2008 they can be used for 12th grade students under the new rules.\"They used to limit the grades that could be served by the LAP,\" said Chase. He is unsure of how the expansion will affect school budgets.Also approved, after a decade of failed attempts, was the authorization of 15 new charter schools over the next three years and 45 over the next six years.\"This issue has been very contentious among education, legislators and our community for years, with both sides raising legitimate concerns and feelings,\" said Bergeson. \"But now that this legislation has passed, we will do the very best we can to make this a positive opportunity for the benefit of students and their families.\"\"Charter schools, I think are a bad deal,\" said Chase. \"They're creating a class and school with less regulations under the idea that with less regulations students should do better. Then why don't they give us less regulation?\"Chase said the $67 million the state expects to spend for charter schools would go a long to helping students with such things as driver's education.\"What I wish they would have passed is low income driver's education funding,\" said Chase. \"Our Valley's going to have a lot of teens out there driving without licenses.\"</p><p></p><p>He added that changing the vote on school issues to a simple majority, rather than the 60 percent currently required, would have also been beneficial to schools.", "author": "Melissa Browning", "type": "News Article", "title": "State education legislation gets mixed reviews", "people": ["Terry Bergeson", "Ruben Carrera", "Carrera", "L.

MSDR will pay the school district for all lease associated costs, such as maintenance.The issue goes back to the February school board meeting. At that meeting, school board members approved a request from MSDR Director Lee Campos to purchase a pair of Camrys from Toyota of Yakima. The bids from the Yakima dealership were $20,195 for each vehicle, significantly higher than two other bids received. Tom Denchel Ford submitted in February a bid of $14,212 per car for a 2004 Ford Taurus. At the February meeting, the board also received a bid of $13,429 per car from Harris Ford Inc. in Lynnwood for a Ford Taurus. The board went with the more expensive bid under the understanding it was because the MSDR needed the vehicles immediately.MSDR had received direction from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to purchase vehicles for its staff. Campos explained in February that his staff members were turning in high requests for mileage checks. MSDR staff members have been using their personal vehicles to travel across the state to track the educational progress of migrant students.The day following the February meeting, Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones halted the awarding of the bid until he could clarify some issues surrounding the board's decision. Bones was unable to be in attendance at the February meeting because of personal reasons.Under state law, a governing body using taxpayer dollars has to go with the most conservative bid presented to them unless they can properly justify the reason for going with a higher bid.At a special board meeting on March 10, Bones suggested the board reject all bids submitted at the February meeting and readvertise the process. Bones said he felt the bid specifications weren't as specific as they could have been. Bones told the board he wanted the specifications to outline more what the district was looking for.This time around, Alderwood School District Executive Director of Business Dave Plesha suggested the board go with the bid from Tom Denchel Ford. Plesha said Denchel officials told him they could have the vehicles available in the next few days. Plesha said Denchel originally told him it would be up to 45 days before the vehicles could be delivered.The school board actually went with the state bid amount submitted by Harris Ford Inc of $13,773 per Ford Taurus. The catch is that Denchel agreed to match the state bid, which board members approved.The original state bid amount was $11,753 per vehicle before taxes. The amount rose with the addition of fees for daytime running lights and a 60/40 split fold rear seat. Following license and title fees the final bid amount increased to $13,773 per vehicle.Denchel agreed to provide all the items that were included in the state bid.Some of the items that will be featured in the two Taurus cars include side-impact door beams, power front disc and rear drum brakes, air bags, fabric cloth seats, sunglass holder, outside temperature gauge and digital clock, power windows, air conditioning, remote keyless entry with trunk release, cruise control and deluxe AM/FM/Cassette/CD audio with six speakers.Alderwood School Board member Fred Kilian said he was glad to see the district accept the best offer for the vehicles. Kilian said the savings will prove out in the long run for the school district.", "author": "John Panni", "type": "News Article", "title": "School board reverses itself, awards bid to Denchel Ford", "people": ["Tom Denchel Ford", "Lee Campos", "Campos", "Aaron Bones", "Dave Plesha", "Plesha", "Denchel", "Fred Kilian", "Kilian"], "locations": ["Yakima", "Lynnwood"], "organizations": ["Migrant Student Data", "Alderwood School Board", "Alderwood", "Toyota of Yakima", "Denchel Ford", "Harris Ford Inc.", "Ford Taurus", "Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction", "Harris Ford Inc"], "misc": ["Ford Taurus", "Taurus"]}]}, {"date": "2004-03-29 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "29, Mar 2004", "text": "Obituaries</p><p>Date Published to Web: 3/29/2004</p><p></p><p>EUGENE PATRICK CHARVET JR.</p><p>Eugene Patrick Charvet Jr., 75, of Grandview went to be with his Lord and Savior Thursday, March 25, 2004, from Yakima Regional Hospital.</p><p>Eugene was born Jan. 5, 1929 at the family home, the son of Edna May (Carlson) and Eugene Patrick Charvet.

The class of 2005 will still need 24 credits to receive a diploma, said Birr.Birr also touched on the non-credit graduation requirements of high school students. Students are required to submit a five-year education plan upon entering high school. Freshmen will not get their class agendas until the plan is submitted. The senior project will become a requirement of all high school students beginning with the class of 2006. The class of 2005 will not be required to do a senior project as it is part of their assignment for their contemporary world problems course. Birr told the school board that starting with the class of 2006 even the Running Start students attending Yakima Valley Community College will have to complete a senior project. Currently, Running Start students aren't required to complete a senior project.Birr also touched on the name change for the Certificate of Mastery the incoming freshman class will have to obtain to receive a high school diploma. Birr said the certificate is now known as the Certificate of Academic Achievement.Under course requirements at the high school, students will have to have four credits of English, two credits of health/fitness, two credits of science, one credit of visual and performing arts and one credit of occupational/career and technical courses. Students will need to take one credit of world history, one credit of American history and one credit of contemporary world problems. Birr also told of how students can satisfy their half-credit for Pacific Northwest history by taking the course in the seventh grade instead of high school. High school students also need to take three credits of math or two credits of math if courses include algebra I or geometry.About the only major change in next year's high school course description book is under visual and performing arts. This class section used to be defined as fine arts. The new name eliminates some of the courses that fell under the fine arts program, such as debate. Classes that fall under the visual and performing arts include art, music, desktop publishing and commercial art/animation.Birr said next year's course description book is relatively the same as the previous year. He also noted the high school will be adding advanced placement biology next year. The high school now has nine advanced placement courses. The high school will become eligible for a special designation from colleges once it has 10 advanced placement classes..

The goal was to provide child care, first of all, to teenage mothers attending classes at Alderwood High School. School district staff members would have second dibs on the remaining spaces available in the center, which is located at the corner of Ninth Street and Lincoln Avenue.Martinez said there are a few students who take advantage of the program, but mostly children of teachers are enrolled in the facility.\"What we do is a lot more than just child care,\" said Martinez. \"We've been able to provide that child care piece as well as pre-school.\"</p><p></p><p>Washington Elementary School Vice Principal Diann Zavala has been researching pre-schools to see if the Alderwood School District is ready to provide pre-school instruction within the public schools. Currently, the school district offers developmental pre-school. The majority of the youths in the program are working on language development.\"The goal is to serve all those children who are not being served elsewhere,\" said Zavala.She said that of the 520 kindergartners entering school this year, about 120 of them did not attend pre-school.\"The plan is to have 120 spaces for those not currently being served,\" she said. The pre-school classrooms will be located in each of the elementary schools. If pre-schools in public schools are developed they will most likely begin in the 2005-06 school year.\"It is not our intention to close down (the early learning center),\" Carrera said to parents.</p><p></p><p>\"We want to talk about the cost.\"Carrera said he will be making a presentation to the Alderwood School Board next Tuesday night on some of the cost saving ideas the parents brought up.\"When we started out we asked the board to start the program (financially) and it would pay for itself down the road and it hasn't,\" said Carrera.In its second year the early learning center borrowed $100,000. Carrera said that some of the money lost in the program has been due to state regulations.One of the regulations is that for infants the adult to child ration must be 1 to 4. Carrera said when a fifth child is enrolled an additional full-time staff person must be hired. To take care of the problem infants have been enrolled in groupings of four.Martinez said that children will be put on a waiting list until enough are enrolled to hire another teacher.</p><p></p><p>The teachers at the early learning center are paid better and have benefits that are not available to teachers at other day cares, said Carrera.\"We expect more of them and we expect them to give our children better care,\" said Carrera.This year the early learning center is lacking $57,000 to balance the budget.Carrera said that as a group, parents and the staff of the center need to look at ways to cut the costs.Parental ideas included helping purchase materials for the class, parents providing janitorial services, a raise in tuition and seeking grants.Concerned that the center may be closed, Outlook Elementary School teacher and a parent of a student at the early learning center Stephanie Parsons has been looking at different options to help make up the funding needed to keep the center alive.One option she came across was the school district co-opting with the City of Alderwood or Alderwood Community Hospital, allowing employees of those two entities to use the services of the childhood center.</p><p></p><p>One concern was that parents outside the school district wouldn't want to use the facility because it closes for the summer, but questions were raised as to the possibility of keeping the center open.", "author": "Melissa Browning", "type": "News Article", "title": "Parents rally to save child care center", "people": ["Ruben Carrera", "Lydia Martinez", "Martinez", "Diann Zavala", "Zavala", "Carrera", "Stephanie Parsons"], "locations": ["Alderwood", "Ninth Street", "Lincoln Avenue", "Washington", "Alderwood Community Hospital"], "organizations": ["Alderwood School District 's Early Childhood Learning Center", "Alderwood School District", "Alderwood School Board", "Carrera", "City of Alderwood"], "misc": []}, {"date": "23, Apr 2004", "text": "Parazuelan pastor dies watching \"Passion of Christ\"</p><p>Story by: Ellie Olmsen</p><p>Date Published to Web: 4/23/2004</p><p></p><p>Palancia, Parazuela - A Parazuelan pastor died of an apparent heart attack while watching the Mel Gibson film \"The Passion of the Christ,\" witnesses said on Monday.</p><p></p><p>Jose Santiago, a 43-year-old Presbyterian pastor, had reserved two movie theatres at a Palancia shopping mall on Sunday afternoon to see the film with his family and the congregations of</p><p>two local churches.</p><p></p><p>But halfway through the movie, Santiago's wife noticed that he was no longer awake.

She was born May 19, 1957 in Alderwood, the daughter of Ellen (Nadine-Hand) and Verl Lint. She received her education in Alderwood and proudly graduated from Alderwood High School with the class of 1975.</p><p>Deanna married Rick Bissonette, her high school sweetheart, on Feb. 8, 1976, after he returned from basic training in the U.S. Coast Guard. They were married at the Granger Assembly of God Church. While serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, they made their home in various places around the country, including Connecticut, California, Texas, Florida and Washington State.</p><p>In 1983 Deanna and Rick came home to Alderwood. They turned their love for people and animals into a thriving business (Lower Valley Pets) in Alderwood. They served the community many enjoyable years, making many friends until Deannas sudden loss of health in mid-1999. Deanna was stricken with a severe advanced-stage cancer, so advanced they were forced to immediately sell their business.</p><p>By Gods grace Deanna survived surgery and within six months was hired to work once again in retail, at Payless ShoeSource. Rick went to work part-time with the U.S. Army National Guard. Deanna continued to work in retail through the summer of 2001 until suddenly stricken again by an aggressive, advanced cancer. She became disabled at this time, but continued to live life and rejoice for each day the Lord gave her.</p><p>A devoted born-again Christian, Deanna never questioned or asked why me? She accepted the pain and increasing disability with a divine grace and peace of mind. Deanna truly had the joy and love of Jesus in her heart. It showed in the loving smile every day that she freely shared with everyone. She let her light shine right to the end.</p><p>Deannas greatest joy was worshipping, singing and praising the Lord. Her next greatest joy was spending time with her precious grandbabies. They were in her thoughts toward the last when she said: Give my grandbabies all my love, all of them.</p><p>Deannas favorite hobbies included scrapbooking (grandbaby pictures!), gardening and collecting gnome figurines.</p><p>Deanna is survived by her husband, Rick Bissonette of Outlook, also a devoted born-again Christian; one son, Richard Bissonette and wife, Irma, of Alderwood, both devoted born-again Christians; two precious grandsons, Demetrio Hernandez and Elijah Hernandez; and two very precious little granddaughters, Emily Rose Bissonette (Emie-love) and Aliyah Bissonette (Leah-love). Deanna is also survived by two nephews she loved dearly and helped raise as her very own, William Lint of Outlook and Allen Lint of Yakima. She is also survived by her parents, Verl and Ellen (Nadine) Lint of Outlook; her grandmother, Hatie Mae DeWald of Yakima; three brothers, Don Lint of Alderwood, Dale Lint of Outlook and Randy Lint of Grandview; a very special person to Deanna, Elaine Getsinger (mom #2); and Carolyn Hazzard, like a loving daughter.</p><p>Deannas Christian faith was faith in action. She would want to share this final message of hope from the Word of God with everyone: Comfort one another with these Words But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

The Grizzlies beat the Falcons last Tuesday 2-1 in a shootout to gain an automatic berth to State. The Grizzlies have owned Hanford the past two seasons, losing only once in five games.Pineda said Cheney had a very hard style to play against.\"They are a good team,\" said Pineda.Pineda said Cheney runs a lot of overlaps. Cheney also has a style that has four defenders, which allowed the Blackhawks to attack or play defense with five players because of the set-up on the field.\"The boys were able to destroy that,\" said Pineda. \"It took a while.\"Pineda strung out his forwards, forcing the Blackhawks' defense to come up. With Cheney coming out of its grouping, the Grizzlies were able to attack offensively up the middle, said Pineda.</p><p></p><p>Alderwood's first goal came from Junior Martinez, who was recently named the Mid-Valley League player of the year for the second consecutive season. The Grizzly junior scored at the 15th minute off an assist from Joel Jimenez.The Grizzlies' second goal was off an indirect kick taken by Kyle Van de Graaf at the 26th minute. Van de Graaf flicked the ball to Luis Galvan, who sent a header to Silvano Ramos, who sent the ball past Cheney's goalie in the one-on-one.Alderwood shut down Cheney until the 68th minute, when Blackhawk Devin Merrill scored. Pineda said the goal came off a corner kick that curved past keeper Johnny Hernandez.The Grizzlies outshot Cheney 11 to 8 on goal. Hernandez finished with four saves and Cheney keeper Josh Hooley had seven saves.Pineda said he was very pleased with his defense in the first half.\"Our defense played really well,\" said Pineda. \"We stopped a lot of their runs.\"Pineda credited Cheney with making adjustments in the second half. He said the Blackhawks dominated much of the play in the second half.\"In the final 20 minutes, we had a lot of attacks on our side,\" said Pineda.Cheney broke down Alderwood's defense by using a lot of long kicks to penetrate deep into Grizzly territory.What worked well for Alderwood overall, said Pineda, was that the Grizzlies didn't try to reinvent the wheel.\"We were consistent,\" said Pineda. \"Nobody got out of their usual style of play. We were very disciplined about marking other players.\"</p><p></p><p>Pineda did say he would liked to have seen his team play stronger in the second half. Pineda said the Grizzlies need to realize teams are going to make runs if they are behind and especially at this level Alderwood needs to be ready an entire game.Pineda said it feels good to have won a Regional championship.\"I am really happy,\" said Pineda. \"It is a reflection of every member of our program.\"Pineda expects Tuesday's home game with Hanford to be an exciting one. The Falcons this past Saturday ended West Valley-Yakima's string of a decade-plus of appearances in the State tournament with a 2-0 victory to capture the No. 3 seed into State.\"I think they have had a lot of time to make adjustments,\" said Pineda. \"I think it will be another exciting game.\"", "author": "John Panni", "type": "News Article", "title": "Grizzlies capture first-ever Regional", "people": ["Juan Pineda", "Cheney", "Pineda", "Martinez", "Joel Jimenez", "Kyle Van de Graaf", "Van de Graaf", "Luis Galvan", "Silvano Ramos", "Blackhawk Devin Merrill", "Johnny Hernandez", "Hernandez", "Josh Hooley"], "locations": ["Hanford", "Grizzly"], "organizations": ["Alderwood", "Grizzlies", "Greater Spokane League", "Falcons", "Hanford", "Blackhawks", "Yakima"], "misc": ["Mid- Valley League", "Grizzly"]}]}, {"date": "2004-05-24 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "24, May 2004", "text": "Alderwood School Board Agenda</p><p>Date Published to Web: 5/24/2004</p><p></p><p>Tuesday, May 25, 7 p.m., Denny Blaine Building.</p><p></p><p>I.

Jr. varsity player Julie Taylor earned a patch as did C squad player Laura Aguiar, said Van de Graaf.Alderwood High School soccer coach Juan Pineda started off presenting the individual team awards to outstanding athletes.With 70 percent of the team scoring points this year, Pineda said the team had \"glorious moments this season.\"Receiving the award for Most Inspirational Player was Johnny Hernandez, whom Pineda nicknamed late in the season \"the octopus.\"Pineda said Hernandez is a goal keeper who worked hard in past years to get better even when he wasn't able to give him a lot of playing time.</p><p></p><p>The award for Most Improved was presented to Kyle Van de Graaf, whom Pineda said brought a lot of height to the team this year. He said Van de Graaf was able to bring the ball down and that he was an asset to the team.Described as \"a quiet player with magic in his feet,\" Luis Galvan was awarded the Captains award.\"He made a lot of decisions on the field when I can't be there,\" said Pineda, adding that Galvan's quick thinking is part of the reason the team made it to the quarterfinals this year.The Coaches Award was presented to Rafael Diego, who Pineda said is the type of player that radiates a lot of humbleness.\"He has a humble spirit and is always ready to apply or do the functions we ask him to do,\" said Pineda. \"He's an all-around player, great on defense and great in forward positions.\"Receiving the award for Most Valuable Player was Junior Martinez.\"He was born with a special gift in his feet,\" said Pineda. \"He needs to use his feet for more than just getting on the bus.\"Head baseball coach Dave Martinez described the 2004 baseball team as having desire, commitment and hard work, which is what made the team successful this year.The team tied the school record for the most wins and advanced to the Regional play-offs for the first time in school history, said Martinez.The Coaches Award was presented to Micah Zakahi, who has been part of the varsity baseball program for the past four years.\"He's the guy we went to when we wanted a win,\" said Martinez.</p><p></p><p>Receiving the Inspirational Award was Michael Sanchez, a four-year veteran of the Alderwood baseball program.A player with hopes of becoming a coach in the future was the winner of the Captains Award. R.J. Elizondo has led the team for the past two years both on and off the field, said Martinez.The winner of the Most Improved award was presented to high school junior Chris Newberry, who raised his batting average 200 points in one year, said Martinez. Newberry was one of the lower batters last year, but is now the number 3 batter on the team.The Most Valuable Player award was presented to Derek Uberuaga, who nailed a two-run homer late in the season giving the Alderwood team the lead needed to move forward in their quest for State.Alderwood girls track and field coach Robin Bryson presented the Most Inspirational Award to Daniela Rivera, whom Bryson said is always smiling and willing to step up and do whatever is asked of her.At Districts and Regionals, she was asked to step up and run the 4x400 relay and also run the 4x200, which are run with, at the most, 30 minutes between races.Most Improved was presented to AHS sophomore Fatima Ruelas, who ran the 100, 200, 4x100, 4x200 and ventured into long jump and triple jump this season.Outstanding Performer was presented to Hilary Van de Graaf for her four years of consistent performance for the track team.The Coaches Award was presented to Isley Gonzalez, who Bryson said, \"over the four years she's never ceased to amaze me.\"As a freshman she placed second at State and quickly became the person to beat in 3A distance running. With extra training in the off season, Gonzalez was able to win the State cross country title this past fall and a State track title this spring.Third year trackster Brenden Scott was presented the Most Inspirational Award by Coach Wally Shearer last night. Shearer said that Scott was disqualified at the District meet and was very upset and disappointed, but filled in on a relay the same day.</p><p></p><p>Exchange student Branimir Janjevic was presented Most Improved. Competing in the high jump, long jump and triple jump, for the first time, Janjevic qualified for the Regional track meet this spring.The award for Outstanding Performer was presented to Luke Schilperoort, who accumulated the most meet points for Alderwood this year.The Coaches Award was presented to senior Jeff Davis, who \"...was always about the team,\" said Shearer.\"He was always willing to step in and help in a relay,\" said Shearer, \"even if it was going to hurt his individual record. It was never about him, it was about the team.\"Varsity golf coach Glenn Braman presented the award for Most Improved to Andrew Schutt, who spent hours on the green chipping and putting outside practice.Spending almost as much time on the green in contests with Schutt was Kevin Lick, who was named Most Valuable Player. Lick qualified for the State golf tournament this year for the third year in a row.</p><p></p><p>Assistant Coach Gary Rohde presented the award for Most Improved girl golfer to Megan Downing, who won the same award in 2003. Downing will be the veteran golfer next spring.Most Valuable Player was awarded to Jensie Hernandez, who qualified for the State tournament this spring.Awards for Inspirational and Most Valuable Player in varsity tennis were voted on by the tennis team and awarded to Johnny Plesha.

Culver told the class he had asked to walk with them. \"I'm very honored to be leading you onto the Clem Senn Football Field for the 8 p.m. ceremony,\" he said.\"Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this class,\" Culver told the graduates.He was presented an AHS blanket and an AHS senior mug, as well as an invitation to attend the senior graduation party following Friday night's graduation ceremony.Unlike the rest of the class, who must wear their gowns free of any decoration, Culver will be allowed to adorn his graduation gown with his war medals.Among those medals earned while serving in France, Germany and Czechoslovakia are his American Theater Service medal, the European-African Middle Eastern Service medal, a Good Conduct Medal and his World War II Victory Medal.Culver, who was sharpshooter with the U.S. Army Company D, 10th Infantry, now lives in Kennewick, where he has been active in the Richland VFW Post for 56 years.Culver's opportunity to finally receive his diploma is thanks in part to state legislation created two years ago to honor those in the state who were forced to discontinue their high school education due to service in the war.Culver said it was VFW State Commander Ed Rasmussen who told him about \"Operation Recognition.\"\"He got me the forms and even mailed them in for me,\" Culver said.Culver, who retired from the Teamsters in 1980 and from Hanford in 1987, said he is pleased to be walking with the class of 2004.\"They've even asked me to join them at their 10-year class reunion,\" he said.\"I'll try to be there,\" he smiled.</p><p>", "author": "Jamie Smart", "type": "News Article", "title": "Nearly 60 years later, World War II vet will get his high school diploma", "people": ["Roy Culver", "Culver", "Kennewick", "Heidi Hellner- Gomez", "Gomez", "Ed Rasmussen"], "locations": ["Culver", "France", "Germany", "Czechoslovakia", "Kennewick", "Hanford"], "organizations": ["Alderwood High School", "Alderwood", "`` Operation Recognition", "Clem Senn Football Field", "American Theater Service", "European- African Middle Eastern Service", "Good Conduct Medal", "U.

The members of the class of 2004 were ready to celebrate their coming accomplishment, as well as recognize the role God has played in their lives.During the baccalaureate ceremony the students listened as their classmates read passages from the Bible, sang together and listened as pastor of the Free Methodist Church, Mike Henry, gave the sermon. Also, Alderwood School Board member Bill Wells presented his charges for the class.</p><p></p><p>Before Henry started his address to the class of 2004, he congratulated them on having accomplished one of their goals.\"Graduating from high school is one of the important steps,\" Henry told the graduates. He noted that it is the step that leads to either getting a job or heading off to college.\"I hope you go on to accomplish great things in your life,\" he said.However, Henry went on to explain that accomplishments are relative, depending on how a person measures success. He explained that he had one friend in his life who finished school and decided he wanted to keep surfing, so he got a job making dentures, which gave him the time and the money to keep doing what he loved. However, he had another friend who went on to become the manager of a commercial real estate corporation in downtown Seattle. Henry told the graduates that both men had accomplished success, just in different ways.\"Their motivations were very different,\" Henry said.</p><p></p><p>He said his motivation was also different, taking him down a completely different path in life. Henry told those in attendance that at the age of 13 he received God's call in his life. From that point on he knew his life would be spent serving God. This meant that in college he went on to study religion and Greek, which he said led to spending hours and hours studying.\"I had that motivation and calling,\" he said. \"I was interested in learning.\"But, Henry said he also recognized that he would have to balance all of his studying with other, more adventurous activities. He said he went on to take up everything from mountain climbing to skiing.</p><p></p><p>Henry also found himself on the rowing team, where he met two people that would ultimately inspire him. He had two teammates, one very athletic guy who ultimately died of leukemia, and another unlikely rower, who was a cowboy from Wyoming. When one teammate died of leukemia, he asked the other to try out for the Olympic rowing team. Henry said not only did the cowboy say he would try out, but then he actually did it. He made the Olympic team and went on to become a rowing coach at one of the east coast colleges.Henry explained that it was because of a challenge God put in front of his teammate, that the unlikely rower went on to become an Olympic athlete. He said that one moment, when he promised his dying friend that he would try out for the team, ultimately changed his life.Henry then looked to Proverbs 3, which talks about the importance of trusting in God.\"As you trust God, he will show you the way,\" Henry said.He told the graduates that God will help them each plan their lives.\"Don't say no to surprise challenges that God may put in your path, because it will open avenues,\" Henry said.</p><p></p><p>Henry concluded his sermon by asking God to bless all of the graduates of the class of 2004.Wells then took the podium to charge the graduates, offering them challenges and things to think about in the coming days. He charged them to create a basis of belief, to listen to the prompting of the spirit and to serve their fellow man.The service concluded with the class of 2004 singing together, then bowing their heads to say one last prayer together.", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "Alderwood High class of 2004 comes together for baccalaureate", "people": ["God", "Mike Henry", "Bill Wells", "Henry"], "locations": ["Bible", "Seattle", "Wyoming", "God"], "organizations": ["Alderwood High School", "Free Methodist Church", "Alderwood School Board", "Proverbs"], "misc": ["Greek", "Olympic"]}]}, {"date": "2004-06-07 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "07, Jun 2004", "text": "Grads bid farewell to Alderwood High School</p><p>Story by: Mel Sacher</p><p>Date Published to Web: 6/7/2004</p><p></p><p>Leading 275 students onto the field of Clem Senn Field, 80-year-old Roy Culver was the oldest graduate to receive his diploma at the Alderwood High School commencement exercise last Friday night.Culver graduated as part of the Operation Recognition program, which allows military veterans who left school early to join World War II ranks to receive high school diplomas. As a part of the ceremony Culver not only received his diploma, but a long-awaited standing ovation from the crowd.Culver's recognition set the tone of the event, at which both Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones and class speaker, American History and CWP teacher Monty Johnson, encouraged the young graduates to be part of their communities and vote.Bones also encouraged the graduates to, no later than Saturday, sit down and think about what their goals are and to raise them.\"It's important to set your goals high because you can do it,\" said Bones. \"You are successful. Don't be afraid to fail or challenge your future.\"Johnson addressed the class saying, \"You're the sons and daughters of this community. Take pride in yourselves. We have invested in you and we have invested well.\"He said there is much that faces the graduates as they leave Alderwood and enter the world.Johnson said as Alderwood thrives and grows local residents will try to better it with our own interests in mind, to draw back some of the recent graduates.He encouraged the youths to become a part of their community, whether it be Alderwood or another town. He encouraged the youths to find a community and become a volunteer, join a service club or help a friend in need.\"Don't consider your education complete,\" he said, encouraging the young adults to be constant learners, informing themselves about what is going on in the world around them.He also encouraged the youths to participate in the country's democracy.</p><p></p><p>\"Many of you are 18, or soon will be. I encourage you to vote this fall,\" said Johnson.He added that to vote and not know what you're voting for is worse than not voting at all.\"I know the world holds a lot for you,\" said Johnson. \"So be informed, participate in the process and never ever sell yourselves short.\"Also speaking at the graduation were salutatorian Amy Kilian and co-valedictorians Stacey Gorski and Joshua Barr.Kilian said as an eighth grader she was sick a lot and her grades began to slip. In danger of getting a C, she went to her teacher to beg for a better grade.In her mind, Kilian said, the sky turned black, the teacher sprouted devil horns and bellowed down on her NO!, when in fact that was all in her mind.In reality, Kilian said, when she was in eighth grade she was able to get a B in the class she was afraid she would get a C in and it was the last B she ever got. Kilian said memories are just fact-perception and image.</p><p></p><p>\"Scientists have proven that you choose how you remember things,\" said Kilian.Kilian said she will always remember the funny moments with her classmates, including the slow-motion portions of the drama club's presentation of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.She said if her fellow classmates' memories include Miss Schuette sending them home because their shorts had a 2\" inseam, they probably shouldn't wear those shorts to a job interview.She encouraged her classmates as they leave Alderwood High School to spice up their lives, just like they spice up their memories.Barr said that it was eight years before that he decided to be valedictorian. He said it was because of friends, teachers and family that he was able to make it.\"For better or for worse they form the core of who you are,\" said Barr.As a middle school student, Barr remembers the day his father asked him if he wanted to go to the library.\"Now, it wasn't the library downtown, but it was the one in Richland,\" said Barr, explaining that his father took four hours out of his life just to take him to the library.</p><p></p><p>\"The little things can mean so much,\" said Barr, who is always reading, which he said has been instrumental in his academic success.Barr said as a youngster he didn't want to learn to read, but his mother got him interested, which changed his life.As a second grader, Barr remembers being punished for reading ahead, which almost squelched his interest in education.\"Teachers,\" he said, \"Your job is not just to guide your students though a series of lessons. Don't worry about what they'll learn next year, there are always things to learn.\"Barr said that through his life, God has been his strength.\"He has been my shield, my rock and my saviour,\" he said.Gorski, an award-winning science fair contest participant, examined the class of 2004 as if it were a science fair project.She said the class of 2004 science fair project would be called \"Driven, Determined and Dedicated.\"She said her classmates have not only shown these qualities in their success, but also in their friendships to each other.The hypotheses of the project, she said, is \"We, the class of 2004, can conquer and do anything with hard work, diligence and creativity.\"The goal of the project is to use creativity, put in all you have, be diligent and successful, Gorski said.She said the class has plenty of evidence to support the goals for their projects with pictures of family and friends, state games and meets traveled to, some of which were won and some lost, drama productions, homecoming and Senior Follies, which raised $2,100.She said the conclusion would read that the class of 2004 can conquer anything because they are driven, determined and dedicated.</p><p></p><p>\"You see,\" she said, \"It's scientifically proven that you will succeed.\"Gorski was later presented the Outstanding Senior Girl award. Tanner Kellogg was named Outstanding Senior Boy. Outstanding Senior Boy Athlete was awarded to R.J.

The Annex reported that the agent drained into the Toxic Cubicle, a pit in the floor prevents  agent from reaching other parts of the facility. It was then routed to a tank which holds used decontamination liquid. This is the first spill at the site since 2003, Arthur said.

The third Alderwood commissioner didn't arrive at Wednesday's meeting until after the vote was taken.</p><p></p><p>According to City Attorney Bruce Rinz, there was question as to the language of the rules dealing with lay-offs at the Alderwood Civil Service Commission's last meeting in December. Rinz said because of budget constraints last December the city was forced to eliminate the deputy chief position in the fire department.</p><p></p><p>\"This brought up the question, what happens under civil service rules?,\" said Rinz.</p><p>He said the language of rule 14, which deals with laying off employees, has been described as murky. After working with Lloyd Hazzard, Adam Dent and Bud Jones of the fire department, a revision was written which will help clarify the rule, said Rinz, who added that an example is also included.</p><p></p><p>The rule now states that in cases of lay-off, temporary employees will be laid-off first. Among regular employees, the least senior employee will be reduced in rank to the next lower classification. The person in that classification will be reduced in rank to a lower position until the person with the least seniority in the lowest rank is laid off.</p><p></p><p>Written into the rule as an example, said Rinz, is that if the position to be reduced is battalion chief, the least senior battalion chief will be reduced in rank to captain. The captain with the least seniority will be reduced in rank to firefighter and the firefighter with the least seniority will be laid-off.</p><p></p><p>Rinz said the firefighter who is laid-off will be added to a re-employment list, which will be valid for two years.</p><p>Originally, the rule dealing with re-hiring said that employees would be able to return to work if their certifications were kept up to date, but Rinz said there is a problem with that since when an employee is laid off they lose their ability to maintain certification. Instead, the rule reads that the employee will have to acquire the certifications within six months, or a time approved by the city manager, when hired back. Kunker said in some cases there are tests that are only held every few months and an employee could potentially miss the date of the test depending on when they are re-hired. An employee would also be required to pass a physical agility test.</p><p></p><p>With the changes to the civil service rules, the Commission decided to wait until the next meeting to approve the revisited general rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission.</p><p></p><p>The Commission did approve changing its meeting time to the second Wednesday of every month, at 5 p.m. at the Alderwood Law and Justice Center.</p><p></p><p>At last night's meeting the commissioners also approved the Alderwood Police Department's request for an exam for lateral and entry level patrol officers.</p><p></p><p>\"We're anticipating possible openings within the next month or two,\" said Alderwood Police Chief Ted Mana.</p><p></p><p>\"We would like to have a list available if we choose to fill those positions,\" he added. \"We do not currently have an active list.\"</p><p></p><p>The commissioners voted unanimously in favor of holding testing. The civil service exam for the Alderwood Police Department will be held Saturday, Aug. 28. Sign-ins will begin at 6:30 a.m. at Harrison Middle School with the physical agility testing beginning at 7 a.m. The oral boards will be held at the Alderwood Law and Justice Center that afternoon.", "author": "Mel Sacher", "type": "News Article", "title": "Alderwood Civil Service Commission amends lay-off rules for fire department", "people": ["Mike Hughes", "Bruce Rinz", "Rinz", "Adam Dent", "Bud Jones", "Kunker"], "locations": ["Harrison Middle School"], "organizations": ["Alderwood Civil Service Commission", "Alderwood Fire Department", "Commissioners Rey Pascua", "Alderwood", "Lloyd Hazzard", "Commission", "Civil Service Commission", "Alderwood Law and Justice Center", "Alderwood Police Department", "Alderwood Police Chief Ted"], "misc": []}]}, {"date": "2004-07-23 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "23, Jul 2004", "text": "Alderwood Weekly Lucky Numbers</p><p>Story by Albert Smith</p><p>Date Published to Web: 07/23/2004</p><p></p><p>Greetings Alderwood!

Plesha also updated the board on how the reconstruction of the concession stand at the high school is going.Plesha told board members he has been meeting with city and county officials on issues concerning the new middle school that will be constructed on 57 acres of land along Washout Road, just north of Alderwood Christian High School. Plesha has been discussing issues concerning water and sewer lines and the entry way to the new school with City of Alderwood and Yakima County officials. Currently, the property for the new middle school is outside the city limits, creating some issues with access to water/sewer lines. The school district is looking at hopefully being able to annex the property into the city at a future date. School board member Fred Kilian offered his assistance to Plesha in conducting talks with the Alderwood Valley Irrigation District on what to do with the irrigation canal that runs nearby.In related news to the middle school construction project, school board members approved two resolutions that will assist the district in obtaining reimbursement money from the state. The first of the resolutions approved has Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones and Plesha serving as the authorizing agents for school facilities.

Castro was also awarded a trophy. But the ladle was her surprise award, explained Hulbert. The ladle, inscribed with Washington State Menudo Cook-off 2004, was created by Vince Castro of Wizard Graphics of Granger.\"We had 10 contestants enter their recipes in our menudo contest,\" said Judy Hulburt, a Chamber spokesperson. Her husband, Carl, and Gracelia Valencia were the chairs for the cook-off, which was organized to celebrate the Yakima Valley's rich Hispanic/Mexican culture.Menudo is a popular soup which is typically served with lemon slices, onion, oregano and avocado, which add to the flavor, explained Hulbert. Warm tortillas are also served with the uniquely Mexican dish.Juana Ibarra of Alderwood was the first place winner in the junior cook-off division. She received a Granger Chamber of Commerce t-shirt and plaque for her award winning entry.Earning second place in the adult division was Isabel Martinez of Granger, who received a $100 cash prize. Third place went to Teresa Cardenas, who received a $50 cash prize, and Teodora Delgado, also of Granger, was the fourth place winner of $25. All winners received a t-shirt.Judges for Saturday's event were Guadulupe Sotelo of Radio KDNA, Granger City Councilman Ernie Guerra, Yakima County Auditor Corky Mattingly, Alderwood City Councilwoman Jennie Angel and Bernie Jaramillo of the Washington State Migrant Council.\"The judges took their job very seriously,\" said Carl Hulbert.He said the judges sampled each entry twice. \"We also had four Granger School District students helping with the judging,\" he said.\"We were very pleased with the contest and plan to do it again next year,\" he added.In addition to the contest entries, the Granger Chamber of Commerce members cooked up six pots of menudo, which they had on sale, along with 10 dozen ears of fresh corn. \"We sold out,\" said Hulbert.He said proceeds from the contest entry fees and the menudo sales will be used to held fund the city's new aquatic center.Later in the day, following the cooking contest, entertainment was held in the park for an estimated 200 people who attended the fiesta-style event.

This happened because the different political parties successfully argued in court to change the old primary election system. Based on the court decision, the state adopted a new way of conducting primary elections. Voters taking part in the primary will be forced to pick a political party to cast their votes for. If a person casts a vote for more than one political party, none of their votes will be valid. Chavez said under the new eSlate voting system the county will be using, the party affiliation voters make will still be private. If voters choose not to pick a party affiliation during the primary election, they can still have input on the non-partisan races for such positions as superintendent of public instruction and the different court races. Voters who do not take part in the primary will still be able to vote in the general election in November.</p><p></p><p>Absentee voters will also face a new election system this fall, said Kathy Fisher, elections technician with Alderwood County. Fisher said since the federal government did away with punch cards, absentee voters will utilize a paper voting system, using a process similar to filling in the bubble.</p><p></p><p>The county will be using the new computerized eSlate voting system at the polls for elections, instead of the former punch card system.</p><p></p><p>The Alderwood County Auditor's Office spent $877,000 to make the move from punch cards to the new eSlate voting system. The country received a $545,000 grant from the federal government to assist with the voting transition program. With the money, said Fisher, the county purchased 155 regular eSlate machines and 45 eSlate machines that provide handicap access.</p><p></p><p>The eSlate machine is an electronic voting system, said Chavez. The way the system works is voters, after registering in the poll books, will receive an access code, said Chavez, to put into the machine. Voters simply move the wheel on the machine to cast a vote. Chavez said the machine will provide voters with a chance to review their votes before officially casting their ballots. The votes are recorded in three different locations in the machine after a voter presses the cast ballot button.</p><p></p><p>While the machine seems simple enough to operate, several Council members expressed doubt about placing a vote into a computer.</p><p></p><p>\"That is scary,\" said Councilman Tom Seeger.</p><p></p><p>Seeger predicted there will be problems with the machines, votes will get lost.</p><p></p><p>Chavez said the county has the ability to do a paper audit.</p><p></p><p>Fisher also addressed a concern of Seeger's about the votes going out into cyberspace. Fisher said the machines are not plugged into the Internet. She said the information is stored on the machines to be pulled out later. Fisher reassured Council the system does have back-up provisions that will ensure votes are counted correctly.</p><p></p><p>Councilman Jim Sarducci was concerned about people being able to go into a voting booth and using some other form of electronics to tamper with the system. The two representatives from the auditor's office said they would have staff technicians get back in contact with Sarducci about his concerns.</p><p></p><p>The eSlate system will be available in both English and Spanish. Chavez said the county was recently forced to comply with a directive from the Department of Justice to institute voting programs that serve both English and Spanish speaking people.

The ninth grade class is in a different complex than the rest of the school.Schuette has an estimated staff of about 130, including 85 certificated personnel.Schuette has been working in education in the Valley for a total of 19 years. She spent 17 years in the Alderwood School, 13 as an administrator, and another two in the Yakima School District.\"It was a wonderful opportunity,\" said Schuette. \"I have always wanted my own building for years. Stanwood is an excellent school. They have a very strong staff and a lot of community support.\"Schuette saw the opportunity for a change after her daughter, Ashley, graduated this past year.Schuette is excited about being involved with some new changes going on. She explained the district completed a facilities study and is looking at what to do with such district buildings as the high school, which was built in 1972. Schuette said the district is also focusing heavily on the changes in educational requirements and looking at addressing the dropout rate for students.\"This is exciting,\" said Schuette. \"I am not coming in during the middle of something.\"Schuette found out about the job when Gary Vegar accepted the job of executive director of instruction and learning in Alderwood. Vegar was the former principal at Stanwood.Schuette has family ties to the Stanwood area. Her sister, Linda Burns, is superintendent of the Arlington School District. Stanwood and Arlington are big football rivals. Schuette said when she went and met the football players a couple of days ago she told them about how important it is to win the rivalry game this year.\"That is going to be fun,\" said Schuette.Alderwood High School Principal Dennis Birr said he is sad to see Schuette go, but didn't want to hold her back from a promising opportunity.\"She is going to be a real loss to us,\" said Birr. \"She has been an instrumental part of the high school.\"Birr said Schuette was key in developing the outstanding vocational program Alderwood has, one of the tops in Eastern Washington.\"I am going to miss her a great deal,\" said Birr. \"We didn't want to stand in her way. She deserves that opportunity.\"Due to the fact Schuette had to give a short notice of resignation, the high school will be doing some administrative functions differently for this year. Holly Ohler will be let out of a couple of her class periods to assume the duties of vocational director. Ohler completed a vocational director internship under Schuette last year. The administrative staff at the high school will be assuming a majority of Schuette's duties, said Birr. However, Birr plans to utilize administrative intern Ryan Maxwell to assist with the workload.Schuette said she regrets leaving so late in the school year to accept the Stanwood job, but is eagerly looking to come back to Alderwood to visit in the next few weeks.\"I have a lot of ties,\" said Schuette. \"You can't leave some place after working for so long without saying goodbye.

He will tell you, straight away, that he is the conservative in the race for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Democrat Patty Murray.This morning (Friday), Davis stopped by the Alderwood Republican Club meeting to talk about his campaign and what he hopes to accomplish if he is elected to the U.S. Senate.Davis said one of his first priorities is regulatory reform, noting that it is something that affects everyone from small business owners to farmers.\"One thing that drives business to its knees...is federal regulation,\" Davis said. He added that on average every business in the state spends $7,000 per employee, per year just to stay in compliance with federal regulations.Davis said he has talked to farmers and business owners throughout the state in regards to their concerns about federal regulations. He said one farmer in particular stood out in his mind, a Kittitas County farmer who told him a that it isn't the fact that a government agency, like the Environmental Protection Agency, comes out to his farm and tells him what is wrong that bothers him.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Davis told members of the local Republic club, what bothered this farmer was the next step in the process.Davis said the government agency then steps in and tries to tell that farmer just how he is going to bring his farm into compliance, regardless of the cost or the effectiveness of the method.Davis said that farmer told him that he feels he should be allowed, with his own ingenuity, to figure out how to come into compliance without a government agency giving him step-by-step instructions.Davis said this is where relief from federal regulations would come in. He explained that it would give farmers and other business owners a chance to work with government agencies to fix any problems that might come up, instead of being forced to work under them.\"We do not create a climate of trust,\" Davis said about the current system. \"We need regulatory relief so [businesses and farmers are] no longer the bad guy,\" he added.Davis then took time to talk about the federal deficit.</p><p></p><p>\"We have to begin to reign in federal spending,\" Davis said.He said the way the federal government is currently spending will ultimately cripple the next generation of Americans. Davis said it is his belief that things like social security can still be saved, noting that people should be given a chance to take a chunk of their money and put it into personal accounts, allowing them to save for the future.When it comes to a constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage, Davis told members of the local Republican club that it is something he supports.\"Children need to be loved by both a mother and a father,\" Davis said. He then pointed to research that suggests children need to have a family that consists of a mother and a father.Davis said the current situation, where courts across the country are making the decision of whether or not same-sex marriage is legal, is not the proper way to go about things. He said he feels that anything less than a constitutional amendment in regards to same-sex marriage, \"...will be nothing more than a stop gap.\"</p><p></p><p>Davis also took time to talk about his support of the Black Rock Reservoir project.\"In this state the farming community really wants one thing - water,\" Davis said. \"I think the most important thing you need is water.\"Davis is running against Rep. George Nethercutt for the Republican nomination to run for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Murray.Davis, who lives in Maple Valley, is an associate professor at Seattle Pacific University, where he teaches classes on political science.

She had done nothing wrong. The only crime she committed was living on the west coast of the United States during World War II.</p><p></p><p>When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, the world changed for Kondo and others like her. People who had moved from Japan to the United States decades earlier were suddenly being accused of spying for their home country.\"You're a traitor, more like a spy. Why, because you're Caucasian or African American or Asian or European or Middle Eastern. There have been allegations against 'your people,' not Americans, but the people [who] share your skin color, of spying. You might not have known, but it's safer to put all of 'you' away, just in case, since color and ancestry, not personality, determines whether you are trustworthy or not.\"This is basically what President Roosevelt said to all people with at least 1/16 Japanese blood living in California, western Oregon, western Washington and southern Arizona, citizen or not, in February of 1942 in Executive Order 9066,\" writes Elizabeth Church, a student in Irene Wells's class at Discovery Lab School in Yakima.</p><p></p><p>The students in Wells's class spent an entire school year researching the experiences of Japanese Americans during the United States' involvement in World War II. The middle school students interviewed Japanese Americans who lived in the Yakima Valley during that point in history, read books about relocation centers and visited museums to learn about the experience.Kondo, one of the women interviewed by the students for the project, said during the taped interview that she remembers calling the relocation centers, concentration camps.\"Relocation center is a nice term for concentration camps,\" Kondo said in the tape.Kondo, who was born in the Yakima Valley and grew up in Wapato, told the students that her father came to the United States from Japan in 1905, with her mother following in 1912. She said her mother grew up in a privileged family in Kobe, Japan, leaving it all to live with her husband in the brush land of eastern Washington.\"You can't imagine what it was like in 1912,\" Kondo said. She explained to Wells's class that it was all sagebrush, with dirt roads meant for horse and buggy traffic.</p><p></p><p>Kondo added that making the adjustment was difficult for her mother, who couldn't speak English.\"I'm not sure how she got through it,\" Kondo said.However, her mother wasn't the only Japanese immigrant working to adjust to life in the Yakima Valley. Kondo explained during the interview that in the 1920s the Valley became a popular area for Japanese immigrants to settle. She noted that once the Japanese began to arrive in the Valley, they started to isolate themselves. She said the Japanese immigrants couldn't speak English, ate different foods and had their own traditions. She told the students that isolation meant they could speak to each other in their own language and eat familiar foods, making it feel more like home.\"It was a small community within a larger community,\" she said.Kondo told the students that the Japanese community in the Yakima Valley had their own clubs and churches. She said the Japanese Methodist Church was established in the early 1920s and the Japanese Buddhist Church was established in the early 1930s in Wapato.One of the reasons Japanese immigrants settled in the Yakima Valley, Kondo said in the tape, was because people coming from Japan were not given the right of citizenship, which meant they were unable to purchase land. She explained that it ended up being easier for them to lease land from the Yakama Nation.</p><p></p><p>\"That is why many of them lived on the reservation,\" Kondo told the students.One of the students in Wells's class, Lauren Antonio, said after hearing Kondo talk about the isolation of the Japanese in America and after reading the book \"Farewell to Manzinea,\" several class members got together to talk about whether or not the students had ever felt isolated from society because they were different.Antonio said during the discussion it became apparent that many of his classmates felt that at some point in their lives they had been bothered because they were different. He said there were a wide range of things that came up during the discussion.Antonio said one thing the entire group agreed on after the discussion, is that although they may have felt singled out or different at some point in their lives, it was nothing like what happened to the Japanese living in the United States more than 60 years ago.Kondo told the students that she can still remember the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. She said on Dec. 7, 1941, she remembers going to church but not hearing the radio announcement that the Navy base had been bombed.\"My father looked very, very troubled when we got home,\" Kondo told the students. \"That was when we realized that Pearl Harbor was bombed.\"", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "Curriculum developed detailing how Americans were forced from their homes and locked away in concentration camps", "people": ["Kara Kondo", "Kondo", "Roosevelt", "Elizabeth Church", "Irene Wells", "Wapato", "Wells", "Lauren Antonio", "Antonio", "Pearl Harbor"], "locations": ["United States", "Pearl Harbor", "Japan", "California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Arizona", "Yakima", "Wells", "Yakima Valley", "Kobe", "Valley", "America", "Manzinea"], "organizations": ["Yakama Nation.", "Navy"], "misc": ["World War", "Japanese", "Caucasian", "African American", "Asian", "European or Middle Eastern", "Americans", "Japanese Americans", "English", "Japanese Methodist Church", "Japanese Buddhist Church"]}]}, {"date": "2004-08-17 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "17, Aug 2004", "text": "Community Calendar</p><p>Date Published to Web: 8/17/2004</p><p></p><p>4-calendar rev.</p><p>updated 8/17/04</p><p>second and fourth Mondays</p><p>Alderwood City Council meets the second and fourth Mondays at 7 p.m. at the Alderwood Law and Justice Center, Homer Street.</p><p>first and third mondays</p><p>Grandview City Council meets the first and third Mondays at 7:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers at Grandview City Hall, 207 W. 2nd St. in Grandview.

He said Alderwood has tremendous potential and its future is bright. \"But that effort takes planning, foresight and citizen involvement, for which I feel I am qualified and am prepared to accept,\" he told the Council.</p><p></p><p>Citing a need to make Alderwood a more attractive place for businesses and citizens, Martinez said more needs to be done to improve the look of the city's entrances.</p><p></p><p>He said his priorities as a potential councilman would be to help make improvements along the Alderwood Valley Highway corridor.</p><p></p><p>\"We are the largest city in the Lower Valley and in order to remain the largest, we need to create an environment that is attractive to all,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Martinez, along with candidates Carol Stone, Theresa Hancock, Ermenejildo Rodriguez Jr., Bruce Epps and Wade Drysdale, was also asked what talents he could bring to the table.</p><p></p><p>Martinez, who has also served on the Alderwood Housing Rehabilitation Committee, said his ability to work well with others, yet keep an independent outlook on topics is one of the skills he would bring to the Council. He said his biggest asset as a councilman is his willingness to make things better by becoming personally involved. I am prepared to accept the challenge and to commit my talent and time to make things better,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>When asked how he would react to being the sole dissenting vote on any given issue, Martinez said, \"Sometimes you have to stand alone.</p><p></p><p>\"But once the decision has been made, as a Council, it becomes time to stand together for the community,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Another priority issue for Martinez is the need for improvements to be made to the downtown business corridor.</p><p></p><p>He said of the decisions Council has recently made which he agreed or disagreed with, Martinez said he was in favor with the adoption of the mobile vending and landscaping ordinances.</p><p></p><p>\"But I also feel that ordinances that restrict youth should be well thought out. We have to make decisions that are viable for all. There has to be balance,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>In favor of pursuing the proposed purchase of the Monson feedlot, Martinez said although he wants the feedlot removed, it depends on the city's ability to finance the issue. He said the removal of the feedlot at the western entrance of the city would go a long way toward improving the city's attractiveness and environment.</p><p></p><p>Prior to Martinez's appointment the council heard statements from the other candidates, including community volunteer Carol Stone, who said her priorities for the city included seeing that the community has more affordable housing. She said she'd like to see more jobs which provide the city's young people with livable wages. \"I'd like to see our kids return here to work and live,\" Stone said.</p><p></p><p>\"I think the water and sewer treatment plant upgrades are very important to the city. I also think the street improvements benefit the safety of motorists and pedestrians alike,\" she added.</p><p></p><p>Stone, who serves on the Alderwood Community Accountability Board, said she has worked hard to make herself aware of the issues facing the city. \"I believe I'm 100 percent qualified to be on the Council,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>Alderwood businesswoman Theresa Hancock said she also believes in the importance of being involved. The owner of the Funny Farm, Hancock has served on Gov. Gary Locke's Retail Liquor Task Force and Contract Manager's Advisory Committee. She also serves on the Black Rock Creek Golf Course Board of Directors. Hancock told the Council she has no particular agenda in seeking to be a Council member.</p><p></p><p>\"I think I can bring my common sense to the table, as well as my desire to make sure all citizens are served,\" she said. Hancock said she has approved of the Council's recent decision to regulate the amplified noise from cars. \"But I was disappointed with Council's decisions regarding the 'ice cream man,\" referring to the Council move to eliminate the ice cream vendors' music.</p><p></p><p>Hancock said her priority issues center on improved infrastructure, bringing more businesses to the city and the overall improvement in the attractiveness of the city.</p><p></p><p>Rodriguez, the youngest of the council candidates, said he believes his ability to be held accountable would serve him in good stead as a councilman. Rodriguez, who works for Hallett Enterprises, said he felt more should be done to bring employment to the community. \"I also think more outlets for youth are needed,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Epps, who is employed as facility manager for the Alderwood Housing Authority, said his background in construction and with budgetary issues would benefit the Council.</p><p></p><p>\"The budget is my top issue.

Saying he approved of the Council's decisions to regulate the mobile vendors in the community, Drysdale suggested the Council occasionally seek the help of the county government.</p><p></p><p>\"Don't be too proud to pass the buck,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Following the Council's 15- minute executive session, Mayor Rex Luthor announced Martinez as the Council's choice to serve on the city's highest governing board.</p><p></p><p>Thanking all of the candidates, Luthor urged them to get involved in other areas of city government.</p><p></p><p>\"We have vacancies on several city commissions, including the Planning Commission and the Board of Adjustment.

The money is used for dues, uniforms and other expenses the girls have, said Gatica. There are 90 troops in the Mid Columbia Council. Six of those troops are in Grandview, five in Alderwood and one in Outlook.Since she learned the news, Gatica and other parents of Girl Scouts have been working to raise the money needed, finding individual donors and businesses interested in supporting Girl Scouts.\"A lot of parents just don't have the funding,\" she said.The troop also made a donation to the fund.Outlook Daisy Girl Scout troop #397 donated half of its winnings for their booth at the Yakima Valley Fair and Rodeo to the \"Give from the Heart\" fund. The other half of the money, or $75, will be used to purchase ceremonial flags, which will be needed as the girls transfer from Daisies to Brownies.The vibrant red display at this year's Grandview fair featured pictures of the girl's activities, as well as the goals the Daisy Scouts learn to live by.\"We were not expecting to win,\" said Gatica.As part of this past year's activities they Outlook group made \"Girls are Great\" suncatchers, said Gatica.Their scrapbook highlighted events such as the Daddy-Daughter Dinner.\"They made invitations for their dads and for half an hour they got to sit down with their dad or grandfather, an adult male who cares about them,\" said Gatica.At the dinner, the girls made each of their dad's favorite dish for the meal.The girls also had a Mommy and Me Tea, said Gatica.\"We taught them how to serve, and etiquette,\" she added.The girls had a Got Sweats drive at Outlook Elementary School and were able to collect three huge boxes of clothing, which will be used for students at the school this next year.After the clothing drive, Gatica said, the girls had to find five additional acts of service that they wouldn't normally do.\"It's about going out and making yourself a better person,\" Gatica added.\"I've already seen a change even in my own child, in her behavior and how she treats people,\" said Gatica.Those interested in donating to the Give from the Heart fund can call the Girl Scout Council, (800) 967-8113.

Browning said he didn't start attending the meetings until later, but he said, he has attended the past five of six years.Last year, the program focused on issues between fathers and sons. He said that although it isn't a problem he deals with personally, he learned that there are a lot of fathers and sons who are alienated from each other.Browning played a video for the Alderwood Kiwanians, the same video shown to the men attending a Promise Keepers conference that told the story of Dick and Rick Hoyt, who competed in the 25th Iron Man competition in 1999.The video showed images of Dick Hoyt pulling a boat carrying his son as he swam one leg of the race. It showed him riding a bicycle with his grown son riding in a seat attached to the front of the bike, and it showed Hoyt pushing his son's wheelchair in the running portion of the race.Hoyt tells how on Jan. 10, 1962 he and his wife knew something was wrong with their son. He was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, cutting off oxygen to the brain.Doctors encouraged him and his wife to institutionalize the youngster at 8 months of age, because they believed the youngster would always be a vegetable. But Hoyt and his wife said, \"No, we're going to take him home.\"Seeing a sparkle in their son's eye, the Hoyt's knew that he wasn't a vegetable. They knew there was someone trapped inside his body.Hoyt and his wife had a computer made to help their son communicate with them. He said that when family and friends came to hear Rick's first words, they expected \"Hi, Mom\" or \"Hi, Dad.\" But the words Rick chose to share were \"Go Bruins,\" referring to the Boston hockey team.Team Hoyt's first race was a charity run for a paralyzed athlete, that Rick talked his father into running.\"We came in second to last,\" said Dick, \"But when we got home, Rick wrote, 'When we run, it feels like my disability disappears'.\"It was after that race that the two started competing in other races and triathlons.Dick said it is an awesome experience to see the support when they reach the finish line.The elder Hoyt also tells in the video that if his son was physically able, he believes Rick would probably play basketball, football or hockey. But Rick says if he was able he would run, pushing his dad in his chair.Competing in races is not the only accomplishment Rick has made. He graduated from a regular high school, as well as Boston University.\"You can do anything you want to do if you make up your mind to do it,\" Dick added.</p><p>", "author": "Mel Sacher", "type": "News Article", "title": "Kiwanians draw inspiration from Iron Man competitors", "people": ["Mc Carthy", "God", "Dennis Browning", "Browning", "Dick", "Rick Hoyt", "Dick Hoyt", "Hoyt", "Rick"], "locations": ["United States", "Dad", "Boston"], "organizations": ["Colorado Buffaloes", "Alderwood Kiwanis Club", "Bruins", "Boston University"], "misc": ["Alderwood Kiwanians", "25th Iron Man"]}, {"date": "20, Aug 2004", "text": "Miss Alderwood candidate 2004</p><p>Story by: John Panni</p><p>Date Published to Web: 8/20/2004</p><p></p><p>One thing Vidi Pasillas prides herself in is being able to see the bright side of people. There is one person in particular who Pasillas sees as a shining star, and that is her younger brother, Juan, who has down syndrome.Pasillas is hoping to see the bright sides of many new people as a member of the Miss Alderwood Court.</p><p></p><p>Pasillas, 17, who will be a senior at Alderwood High School this fall, is one of eight young ladies looking to represent the community as the 2004-05 Miss Alderwood. The annual pageant will be held in conjunction with Alderwood's Sunshine Days Saturday, Sept. 18, at the Alderwood High School auditorium.Pasillas is a native of Alderwood, having lived in the community her entire life. Pasillas credits the strong women in her life with helping her become the person she is today. Pasillas has particular praise for her mother, Maria Rangel, and her grandmother, Elena Zuazo.Pasillas is being sponsored in this year's pageant by Blueline and Les Schwab Tire Center.At high school, Pasillas stays very active. She is involved with Link Crew, which is a group of older students who help incoming freshmen make the transition to the high school. Pasillas is also involved with the leadership class and the Leaders in Action program. Her other school activities include Key Club, cheerleading and fastpitch softball.Outside of school, Pasillas has volunteered at the Just Like Home retirement center and the local food bank. Another of her loves is working with the Special Olympics program. Pasillas became involved with Special Olympics through her brother. After high school, Pasillas wants to attend college to study to become a special education teacher.</p><p></p><p>\"He (Juan) inspired me to go in that line of work,\" said Pasillas.When working with Special Olympics, Pasillas said she is at her happiest because she feels she is making a difference.\"I think it is really fun,\" smiled Pasillas. \"They (Special Olympics members) are just funny. They are very honest.\"This year will mark the third season Pasillas has been involved with cheerleading.\"It (cheerleading) was kind of like a little girls' dream,\" said Pasillas.Pasillas explained she's had a desire to be a cheerleader since she was a little girl. Pasillas acted on that dream when she was a sophomore.\"I tried out and I was so nervous,\" said Pasillas.Another of Pasillas' loves is the sport of fastpitch softball. She has been playing softball since she was in middle school.\"When I was in middle school I was kind of the quiet kid,\" said Pasillas.She said none of the other sports such as basketball or volleyball appealed to her much.Pasillas recently found her niche at the prep level on the mound this past summer, where she developed into one of the premiere arms for the Lady Grizzlies.But being involved with family and friends is what Pasillas treasures most. Pasillas said she looks up to her mom and brother. Pasillas said she admires her mom for being a single parent, but always finding time to still support her children.\"She is going back to school (college),\" said Pasillas. \"I am real proud of her.\"Pasillas said her brother also taught her an important lesson about life.\"My brother has taught me not to be judgmental about people,\" said Pasillas.Why run for Miss Alderwood?\"I think it is a great opportunity for any young lady to experience,\" said Pasillas.Pasillas said if she is named to the Miss Alderwood court she wants to inspire young children. Pasillas said she would love to serve as a role model for young girls, inspiring them to compete for Miss Alderwood when they are older.Pasillas said she has great respect for the role the Miss Alderwood Court serves in the community.\"They (Miss Alderwood court members) are making the community a better place,\" said Pasillas.Pasillas did admit she was a bit reluctant at first to vie for the Miss Alderwood title.</p><p></p><p>\"I wasn't sure if I would have the time to do it,\" said Pasillas. \"But then I thought, you only live once, you might as well do it to the best of your abilities.\"What Pasillas enjoys about the community is the people and the diversity.\"Everyone is really friendly,\" said Pasillas. \"We are able to get to know each other.\"Pasillas has several projects she wants to work on if appointed to the Miss Alderwood Court.

Case in point, Damon Palacios of Grandview.Palacios qualified for the American Motocross Association Amateur/Youth National Motocross Championship at Loretta Lynn's ranch in Tennessee Aug. 2-7. Turning 7 in late June, he is now more experienced after being able to compete at a race not too many motocross riders his age get to take part in.Palacios was one of 42 motocross racers in his classification, the 51cc 4-6 Stock Oil Injection division, to compete for national championship honors. Palacios ended up finishing 36th out of the pack. The field featured motocross riders from all over the United States, including Minnesota, Texas, Florida, California and even Bermuda. Palacios was one of only a couple of riders from Washington state.Palacios qualified for the prestigious national race by winning a Regional qualifying event in Washougal in June.Damon's father, Dave, said his son didn't catch much of a break right from the start, getting handed the 38th spot in the gate pick, which put him on the difficult opposite side of the first turn.\"It was strictly luck of the draw,\" said Dave.Damon said he had never raced on a course like the one at Loretta Lynn's estate at Hurricane Mills.\"The course was hard,\" said Damon.Damon added he had never seen so many expert riders as he did at the national championships.The most difficult spot on the course, said Damon, was an area referred to as \"The 10 Commandments.\" The commandments are a set of 10 hills that riders hit in consecutive stride.\"There are a lot of ruts on them,\" said Damon.Damon said the commandments were very chLofferging because as soon as he would come down one hill, he would hit another that would send him shooting back into the air.Damon, though, said he was pleased for the most part with how he rode.Dave thought his son did well at the event, even though he said Damon would have liked to done better. Dave said on a couple of the turns his son was dead last and worked his way back through the pack.Besides competing, Damon said he had a great time watching the \"big guys\" race. Damon said it was exciting to see them speed around the course.Damon also had a good time playing in Hurricane Creek, a river running through Lynn's estate. Damon said he saw all sorts of creatures such as crawfish and frogs.\"It is very kid oriented there,\" said Dave.Dave said Lynn's estate had all kinds of areas dedicated to keeping youngsters busy, including an arcade.\"It is something a kid would dream of,\" grinned Damon.Damon also had the opportunity to see two of his idols at the event, motocross riders Bubba Stewart and Ivan Tedesco.Damon and his parents took time out during their two-week excursion to see some of the sights along the way. Among the places the family stopped at were Mt. Rushmore, the St. Louis arch, Graceland, the Sears Tower in Chicago, Abraham Lincoln's birthplace and the Crazy Horse memorial. Dave said they also had a chance to tour Lynn's home.Damon also had the chance to take his first taxi cab ride, which he said was something to experience in a \"big city.\" Damon said his favorite stop on the tour was the Greyhound Hall of Fame in Abilene, Kansas, a museum dedicated to dog racing. Damon said he liked looking at all of the dog items in the museum.Dave said he was very proud of how his son did.\"A little better gate pick and he could have easily been in the top 20,\" said Dave.Palacios said there are a lot of motocross races that a person can compete at, but Lynn's is the biggest one.\"This is by far the most prestigious one to go to,\" said Dave. \"It is kind of like the Rose Bowl.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>", "author": "John Panni", "type": "News Article", "title": "Palacios returns from national motocross race", "people": ["Damon Palacios", "Palacios", "Loretta Lynn", "Damon", "Dave", "Lynn", "Bubba Stewart", "Ivan Tedesco", "Rushmore", "Graceland", "Abraham Lincoln"], "locations": ["Grandview", "Tennessee", "United States", "Minnesota", "Texas", "Florida", "California", "Bermuda", "Washington", "Washougal", "Loretta Lynn", "Lofferging", "Hurricane Creek", "St. Louis", "Chicago", "Crazy Horse", "Abilene", "Kansas", "Rose Bowl"], "organizations": ["American Motocross Association Amateur Youth National Motocross Championship", "Hurricane Mills", "Sears Tower"], "misc": ["Greyhound Hall of Fame"]}, {"date": "20, Aug 2004", "text": "Alderwood Weekly Lucky Numbers</p><p>Story by Albert Smith</p><p>Date Published to Web: 08/20/2004</p><p></p><p>Good folk of Alderwood!

With at least two years left, she doesn't think he has anything to worry about.Carrillo is currently the secretary for DK Bain Real Estate, but she has dreams of one day becoming a nurse. After 13 years of waitressing, Carrillo returned to secretarial work with the help of People for People.\"When I started their program I didn't know how to work a computer. I was really intimidated by computers,\" she said.After attending business school in Albany, N.Y., Carrillo worked as a secretary in upstate New York, where she lived prior to moving to Washington. But as technology advanced and more secretarial work involved computers, Carrillo left her secretarial career.\"I was so intimidated by the computer I gave it up,\" she said.Eventually she returned to secretarial work, but Carrillo said her first days at DK Bain she began freezing up the computers.\"I accurately type 100 words a minute,\" she said. \"The computer couldn't keep up with me.\"Since she started at DK Bain five years ago, Carrillo has learned many skills on the computer. She now makes brochures and advertisements for the office, as well as updates listings on the computer and the office webpage.\"I work for more than one person in this office. I work for all the agents,\" she said.Returning to her secretarial career helped her realize her life-long goal of becoming a nurse, which helped her make the decision to return to college.\"Ever since I was 15 I wanted to be a nurse,\" said Carrillo. \"Nursing is my dream.\"To obtain that dream, besides working, she is a full-time student, starting her days as early as 8 a.m. and taking classes well into the night. She has also taken Saturday classes to help finish her degree. When she is finished, Carrillo hopes to become an operating room nurse.\"I hope I am teaching my children that no matter how old you are you can obtain your goals and dreams,\" she said.Although living in Washington is far from Carrillo's family, her mother lives in Missouri, Carrillo finds it home because it is where her three children and husband of three years, Pedro, are living.\"I've never met such a caring community,\" said Carrillo. \"I think the community is the best part of living here.\" But, she added, \"The sunsets here are breathtaking.\"She said she also enjoys how the orchards and vineyards climb the foothills surrounding the Lower Valley. Occasionally, when she is homesick for upstate New York, Carrillo said she will drive to Chinook Pass to enjoy the fall colors, which remind her of home. Besides attending school, Carrillo enjoys baking, cooking and crocheting. She has crocheted an afghan with a picture of deer on it and even an afghan displaying DK Bain's name and logo.\"I don't know how to follow a pattern, but I figure it out as I go,\" she said.</p><p>", "author": "Mel Sacher", "type": "News Article", "title": "Working Stiff", "people": ["Carol Carrillo", "Carrillo", "N.

But by the time everything was said and done, the Council reached a consensus of sorts that the public will eventually decide what kind of ambulance/fire department service it wants.</p><p></p><p>For the past 15 years, Alderwood residents have been paying a $3 per month fee to help fund the city's ambulance service. Residents were billed the fee along with their water and sewer service, said Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford. The fee generated $140,000 per year. The city has been supplementing the service to the tune of $600,000, said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>The problem for the city in collecting the fee came this past May when the Washington Supreme Court ruled an ambulance service fee the City of Kennewick was collecting was illegal. Rockford said since Alderwood adopted the same fee structure Kennewick did it meant the city's fee was also illegal. This past June, Alderwood officials suspended collecting the ambulance utility fee from residents.</p><p></p><p>Rockford presented Council Monday night with an ambulance fee the city could implement that he believes could pass the legal requirements of the courts.</p><p></p><p>Rockford said the major difference between the fee he is proposing and the former one is it is not only assessed to residents, but businesses, as well.</p><p></p><p>\"It is set up as a utility fee,\" said Rockford. \"It has some of the characteristics of our water and sewer utility.\"</p><p></p><p>The fee would assess a $3 per month charge to all households on the basis 3.6 residents are living at each home. Businesses would then be charged $3 per month for every 3.6 employees they have up to a maximum of 101 employees.</p><p></p><p>Rockford explained residents in the city limits of Alderwood would be charged a city rate for services provided while residents out of city limits would be charged a higher fee to utilize the local ambulance service. Out-of-town residents will roughly see a $300 increase in prices for city ambulance service.</p><p></p><p>Rockford added that with the addition of the businesses having to absorb the monthly fee, the city will raise an additional $72,000 for the ambulance service.</p><p></p><p>Another part to the discussion centered around raising the Medicaid/Medicare rates to where the city is being reimbursed appropriately. The city currently charges Medicaid/Medicare extensively lower reimbursement rates than it should, said Rockford. Rockford was proposing across the board increases for everything from mileage to medical care, estimating the city would receive $40,000 in additional funding from Medicaid/Medicare.</p><p></p><p>Rockford said Alderwood must have some sort of ambulance service to offer its residents.</p><p></p><p>\"To some extent a fire department is an insurance policy,\" said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>He said in going out into the community he has heard continuously from residents how much they like the ambulance service the city offers now. Rockford said the key for the Council is to agree on a structure for the ambulance service that the city can depend on for revenue.</p><p></p><p>\"The ordinance we feel will pass the mustard in court,\" said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>Rockford said he wants to continue discussion in September with the Council on the proposed ambulance fee. He also wants to hold an open house to invite local business owners to offer input on how the fee would affect them.</p><p></p><p>Council agreed unanimously to change the Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates to the higher amounts. A public hearing with expected adoption is set to take place at the Monday, Sept. 13, Council meeting.</p><p></p><p>The Council couldn't quite agree so whole-heartedly about the ambulance service fees.</p><p></p><p>Councilman John Torch was concerned about shifting costs to businesses. Torch wanted to open up discussion with other cities about how they handle ambulance services before agreeing to any set fee.</p><p></p><p>Councilman Tom Seeger, who has been adamant about how the ambulance service is a drain on the current expense fund, expressed his opinion on the matter. Seeger said only 5 percent of cities statewide provide an ambulance service with their fire department.</p><p></p><p>\"There is a reason,\" said Seeger. \"They are black holes that suck money. It is nice to have a Cadillac service, but we are paying a Ferrari price tag.\"</p><p></p><p>Seeger wanted to do a comparison with Grandview on why that city can maintain a fire insurance rating of five while only having two paid firemen.</p><p></p><p>Seeger wants to leave the choice to local residents on whether they fund the ambulance service or not. Seeger suggested putting the measure before voters during a special February ballot issue. But, Seeger wanted to remind residents that if they vote to keep the present ambulance service with the monthly fees that have been suggested then they are going to have to pay for the construction of a new fire station down the road. Seeger said with privatizing the ambulance service residents would not have to pay for a new fire station. Seeger said he didn't believe the fee that was being proposed to fund the ambulance service would be enough. Seeger said the city would need to charge residents and businesses $5 to $6 per month to see any economic benefit.</p><p></p><p>Council members brought into the discussion regionalization of the ambulance service and how a business fee for the service might deter economic growth in the community.</p><p></p><p>\"The only way it is going to pass the mustard of the court is (if we) charge residents and businesses,\" said Rockford. \"By applying it city-wide we pass the mustard of the court.\"</p><p></p><p>.

But of the 24 students who took the ACT this past year, the average score was 20.8 on the test, she said.The national average is 20.9. However, the Alderwood students' average was slightly below the state average of 22.5.Washington was ranked among the top three states in the nation for outstanding performance on the ACT. Only Vermont and Maine ranked higher than Washington, said Dr. Terry Bergeson, the state superintendent of public instruction.Bergeson said the state's results from the ACT is a strong indication that the work being done in Washington schools is better preparing students for life after college.\"I'm particularly pleased to see that, as more of our diverse students participate in this test, our scores remain high. This is truly a success story we can be proud of in our state,\" Bergeson said.ACT is one of two widely recognized exams used to gauge readiness for college. While not a required state assessment tool, the ACT, like the SAT, measures a student's readiness for college in English, reading, math and science. Scores are given on a scale of 1 to 36 with 36 being the best possible score.\"Our students earned scores from 13 to 29,\" said Kilian.Mirroring the national increase in participation, more Washington graduates are choosing to take the ACT.\"We are seeing more of our students taking the ACT,\" Kilian said.Nevertheless, the SAT remains the most popular of the college readiness exams taken by Alderwood students, she added.\"It (the SAT) is just the test most students are more familiar with as a pre-college exam requirement,\" she explained..

Here in the Alderwood Valley, not only are we faced with the arduous task of choosing which candidates to vote for, we must do so using a brand new primary system. And to top it off, for those of us who still trek to our polling sites to cast our votes, we'll be voting on state-of-the-art machines that are bound to confuse and dismay the electronically-challenged (yes, I fall into that group).</p><p></p><p>You can blame the \"hanging chad\" for the new computerized voting machines. Damn those Floridians.</p><p></p><p>As for the new primary election system that will be in place this September, it's kind of difficult to figure out who to hang the blame on. You can curse both political parties if you choose, since both Republicans and Democrats were in favor of doing away with the old primary system. Personally, I throw the blame at our judicial system-or more specifically, those judges who refused to uphold the old system when the whole, sordid mess was sorted out in court. Seems like everything we're allowed to do, or forbidden to do, these days is decided in court, doesn't it? Instead of a majority-rule society, all of the important decisions are being made by single entities-namely, those justices who sit with gavel in hand and robes flowing, spewing out the turns and twists we must make in our lives.</p><p></p><p>But I digress. The point of this column is to point out the difficulties we all face in choosing the right candidate for the job at hand.</p><p></p><p>This year's elections offer no real local races, with the exception of two county commissioner spots that are coming open. When it comes to voting for a city councilman or school board director, most of the time we're all familiar with the people who've thrown their hats into the ring. We base our decisions in those kinds of races on our personal dealings with the candidates, or on the encounters our friends have had with those running for public office. Word of mouth spreads quickly in small rural towns like ours, and it's not all that difficult to choose the right person for the job.</p><p></p><p>It's a different matter when it comes to voting for the president of the USA, or for a U.S. senator, or a governor or a public lands commissioner. We don't really know the people running for these highly visible jobs. They don't live in our communities-who are they, what do they represent, are they qualified to do the job?</p><p></p><p>Very few of us actually do the research or the reading required to select the best man or woman for the job. Instead, we are made privy to sound bytes-30-second commercials (which usually downgrade their opponents instead of filling us in on what the qualifications of that particular candidate are), and we use this useless information to help us decide on who to vote for.</p><p></p><p>Many among us vote straight Republican or Democrat. That eliminates the chore of learning who the candidate is. If they're a Republican, we figure chances are they're against abortion, want to stimulate the economy by lowering businessmen's taxes and are in favor of strengthening the military. If the candidate is a Democrat, most of us voters assume he or she wants to make college accessible to every person in the entire world, believes in raising the taxes of the rich and wants to outlaw every handgun that exists in this country. Heaven help a candidate who declares himself an independent. Most voters figure such a person is a non-conformist, a looney of sorts, and would not be effective in public office.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, we don't live in a black and white world. There are many gray areas when it comes to politics. Not all Democrats subscribe to every mandate detailed in the national Democratic platform, the same holds true for Republicans and the national platform they have adopted.</p><p></p><p>But we don't take the time, or make the time might be more accurate, to look into the lives of these candidates and what they stand for.</p><p></p><p>So who do we vote for?</p><p></p><p>You tell me. I'm open to suggestion. From now until the elections are over in November, I encourage you to write a letter to the editor and we'll publish your reasons why we should vote for a particular candidate.

A member of three different economic development boards, New Vision, the Yakima Valley SEID Board and the Resource Conservation Development Commission, Camay has been on the front lines of economic development. He said as a member of the SEID board he has had a hand in Lower Valley projects, including the nursery in Mabton and the Wal-Mart distribution center in Grandview.</p><p></p><p>The Resource Conservation Development Commission has assisted in developing the Toppenish Highway tourist radio station.Camay has also favored the restructuring of the county's permitting and planning departments to develop a one-stop-shop for those looking to develop or build in the county. He said the county is offering a money-back guarantee to ensure that permits and plans are processed in a timely manner.A touchy subject, the new county jail, which is currently under construction in Yakima, Camay addressed club members' concerns saying that he did not make the decision in a vacuum. Lower Valley sites in Alderwood, Grandview and Toppenish were considered by a citizen siting committee, but ultimately, after the county purchased land in Toppenish that didn't have water rights. Yakima was chosen as the site for the new jail. County Commissioner Jesse Palacios, who was also at the Republican Club meeting, said that they were told by Toppenish City officials through the process that the land had water rights. But there are two different kinds of water rights. The land had rights for how much water flow was allowed in a year, but now for how much water could be pumped in a day, said Camay.The Yakama Nation brought the water issue to the county commissioners' attention during the SEPA process.Camay added that he believes the Yakima fairgrounds location was the best for the county. Although one of his opponents vows to stop construction on the jail if elected, Camay said stopping the jail project would cost the county $5 million.</p><p></p><p>Palacios explained that bonds were sold to build the facility. If the county were to stop the project the bonds would still have to be repaid.\"The revenue from the jail is supposed to pay for the bonds,\" he added.Since 1994, the county has been able to gain $53 million from jail bed sales, said Camay. Looking to the future he said it will cost the county $27 million just to house its own population.\"The bottom line is we had to build anyway. This way we don't have to pay for it,\" said Camay, who agreed that although the jail numbers and costs are just projections, he felt it best to be prepared.Palacios said that the commissioners would have been criticized either way. He said if they didn't build the jail when they had the opportunity they would have been criticized in the future when the need was great.</p><p></p><p>\"In the long run I believe it will save us money,\" Palacios added.Camay said that the siting committee was down to one site in Alderwood that looked feasible, but the cost to purchase the property and help Alderwood with a sewer system upgrade was not cost effective.\"I think that's (the sewer system) part of the reason Alderwood wanted us to come-as a solution to their problem,\" said Camay.Former Alderwood City Councilman Chad Werkhoven further questioned Camay on the jail project, asking why the county commissioners were not at a meeting billed as a public hearing, which was held in Alderwood.Werkhoven said that the citizen siting committee was on-hand, but made it very clear that they had no intention of siting the jail in Alderwood.\"It turns out it wasn't a public hearing, it was a dog and pony show,\" said Werkhoven.Camay countered that the siting committee was part of the process of selecting a site for the facility.\"You don't have them do your thinking for you,\" answered back Werkhoven, who added that statistics are like eggs, you can cook them any way you want to.\"It was our understanding here in Alderwood, that it would have been very cost effective,\" said Dr. Randy Schuler, who also attended the meeting.At the meeting Camay was also asked if he supports the Black Rock Creek Reservoir project.\"We've been there all the way,\" said Camay.</p><p></p><p>Although there aren't any county funds to spare to support the project at this point, Camay said $110,000 has already been given to the project. Yakima and Benton counties contributed $100,000 to the feasibility study of the project and $10,000 was given by the county to start a website to inform residents on the project.\"Personally, I've given funds to the Black Rock Creek project,\" Camay added.</p><p>", "author": "Mel Sacher", "type": "News Article", "title": "County commissioner stumps for votes", "people": ["Tom Camay", "Camay", "Jesse Palacios", "Palacios", "Chad Werkhoven", "Werkhoven", "Randy Schuler"], "locations": ["Yakima County", "Toppenish", "Lower Valley", "Yakima Valley", "Mabton", "Grandview", "Toppenish Highway", "Yakima", "Alderwood", "Black Rock Creek Reservoir", "Benton", "Black Rock Creek"], "organizations": ["Alderwood Republican Club", "New Vision", "Resource Conservation Development Commission", "Yakima", "Toppenish City", "Yakama Nation", "Alderwood", "Alderwood City"], "misc": ["Wal- Mart", "Republican Club"]}, {"date": "27, Aug 2004", "text": "Alderwood School Board approves $50.1 million budget</p><p>Story by: Ellie Olmsen</p><p>Date Published to Web: 8/27/2004</p><p></p><p>Thursday evening, the Alderwood School Board unanimously approved a $50.1 million budget for the 2004-05 school year. The newly approved budget is an increase over the $45.6 million budget school board members approved last year.Although budget expenditures are greater this year, so is the amount of revenue the district is expecting to bring in during the 2004-05 school year. According to the new budget the district is expecting $51.9 million in revenue for the year, up from $47.9 million last year.</p><p></p><p>Dave Plesha, executive director of business for the Alderwood School District, explained that one of the reasons for that increase is a $2.5 million grant for which the district applied. He noted that the grant would make the Alderwood Secondary Education of Migrant Youth (SEMY) location the keeper of the national database for migrant students. Plesha explained that even if the district ends up not receiving the grant it is something that had to budgeted for, just in case the district is selected.Also increased this year is the number of students expected to walk through the doors of the schools that make up the Alderwood School District.This year's enrollment is expected to increase by approximately 48 students. This year the district is expecting to have 5,442 students enrolled in Alderwood schools, which is up from the 5,394 that attended classes last year. Plesha also pointed out there are 34 students expected to take advantage of the Running Start program, which allows students to attend classes at Yakima Valley Community College while still being a student at Alderwood High School.Often times when there is an increase in the number of students, there is also an increase in the number of teachers and other school staff members, and this year is no different. The Alderwood School District plans to employ 364 certified staff members and 230 classified staff members. This is an increase of seven certified staff members over last year, and an increase of 10 classified staff members.</p><p></p><p>Plesha noted that this year's budget reflects only a few small raises for district staff members holding certain positions. He explained that the state allowed for a 1 percent pay rate increase for classified staff members. Plesha also pointed out that teachers will be receiving anywhere from no raise to a 7 percent raise this year depending on how many years they have been teaching and whether or not they earned any college credits over the past year. Plesha noted that the state also granted no raise for administrators this year.When it comes to the capital projects fund, Plesha explained that the entire amount of the bond issue recently passed by voters is included in the $11.4 million budget. Plesha said this year money from the capital projects fund will help get the new middle school project started. The new school is expected to be constructed on land located along Washout Road. Plesha said although the entire amount to the bond is in the budget, he is only expecting to spend about $3 million this year.The transportation vehicle fund is also seeing an increase in funding this year. According to the budget, the fund totals $784,600, compared to $767,000 last year.This year the debt service fund shows a slight increase over last year. This year total expenditures are budgeted at $1.8 million compared to $1.31 million last year.The dollar amounts in the Associated Student Body Fund only shifted by roughly $7,000. This year the budget is set at $517,801, which is a little more than the $510,710 budgeted last year.", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "Alderwood School Board approves $50.1 million budget", "people": ["Dave Plesha", "Plesha"], "locations": ["Alderwood", "Yakima Valley Community College", "Washout Road"], "organizations": ["Alderwood School Board", "Alderwood School District", "Alderwood Secondary Education of Migrant Youth", "Running Start", "Alderwood High School", "Plesha", "Associated Student Body Fund"], "misc": []}, {"date": "27, Aug 2004", "text": "Religious Reflections</p><p>Date Published to Web: 8/27/2004</p><p></p><p>Donna Homer</p><p></p><p>It is disheartening when we hear daily about more soldiers' lives lost in Iraq and of the lives of innocent people in Iraq who are killed in the conflict.</p><p>It was disheartening, I am sure, to Jesus's disciples after he was crucified.

They love them, but it is the men who come in and buy the large ticket pieces,\" she said.\"Women always tell me they have to ask their husbands before they can spend upwards of $1,000 per painting,\" she explained.</p><p></p><p>\"They do buy a lot of our smaller, less expensive items,\" she added.The couple told the more than 25 people attending the Chamber event they launched a number of advertising campaigns before settling on a television advertising campaign, which is finally yielding the desired results, Mr. Phinney said.\"We get our best response from our spots which run closest to sporting events, like golf, and new programs, such as 'Good Morning America',\" he explained.The couple said they get a lot of business from the Tri Cities and Yakima areas. \"But we continue to hear a lot of people say they were unaware we were here,\" said Mrs. Phinney.\"We are happy so many of you decided to come and see us at this event,\" she added.Choosing the Knothole Gallery as its first host for the Chamber after hours event was a matter of the Chamber wanting to help promote a local business and the need to launch its new membership program, said Kathy Corliss, the Chamber's director of promotions and tourism.\"Lloyd and Ellen Phinney came to us asking what they could do to make more Alderwoodrs aware that they are the Thomas Kinkade dealers in town. Asking them to host this event also fell right into our plan to reinstate the after hours program,\" she explained.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm pleased to see so many new faces at this event,\" she added.The long-time Alderwood couple originally opened their business in the Alderwood Mini- Mall, but soon found they needed a location with more curbside exposure. Their current Yakima Valley Highway location offers the couple that exposure, as well as additional room for larger displays of the Gallery's paintings and related products. Open six-days-a-week, the couple also makes use of the Internet to help advertise their business. They also make use of an extensive mailing list, said Mrs. Phinney.\"We currently have 1,200 people on our mailing list, who can look forward to getting the Thomas Kinkade Gallery Christmas catalog in a few weeks, she added.In addition to learning more about the Phinneys' gallery and the extensive line of Thomas Kinkade projects, those who attended the after hours event learned a little more about other events being planned in Alderwood.Alderwood High School senior Lizeth Chiprez asked the chamber members and guests for support of her senior project. The enterprising young woman has developed a tutoring program for students preparing to take their college entrance exams.\"So many of our students need additional study with such things as vocabulary and literature in order to pass their SATs,\" she told the group.This past summer Chiprez created a plan to offer after school tutoring to college-bound students using Heritage College students as mentors.\"But I need your help to purchase the necessary study books,\" she said.She said she has made arrangements to purchase the books, at the cost of $5 each. \"I'm hoping you will be willing to donate to this important cause,\" she explained.</p><p></p><p>\"We plan to serve 80 students in the first year,\" Chiprez said, adding she hopes the program will expand in the future.\"\"This type of networking is exactly what we hoped the after hours program would encourage,\" said Tom Gaulke, president of the Chamber board of directors.\"We are hoping all of those who attended this first event will be come Chamber members, if they aren't already,\" he added.The next Chamber after hours program will be held at the Alderwood Worksource office in the Mid Valley Mall on Tuesday, Sept. 28.

Grandview's fair is just one of three community fairs held annually in the Yakima Valley, besides Toppenish's and West Valley's.</p><p>How are these fairs threatened? Because the county budget of $390,000 for Yakima County WSU Extension's match is in jeopardy. While about 80 percent of the county's nearly $55 million budget for law and justice is essential in keeping our communities safe, it is also essential to keep the positive impacts that Extension brings to the residents of Yakima County.</p><p>4-H is based in the Extension Service. If Extension was eliminated, the 4-H program in Yakima County would be eliminated. Hundreds of youth in 4-H and FFA participate in county fairs, yet 4-Hers participate about 10 to 1 over those in FFAwhich means the fairs would probably collapse due to lack of participation. This is exactly what happened in Multnomah County in Oregon.</p><p>4-H is just a tip of the iceberg of the benefits of Extension. Extension agents in horticulture and livestock advance those industries with information in cutting edge technology and research. Agriculture is a foundation of Yakima County. The Extension Service is exemplary in using volunteers to improve lifestyles of residents by teaching food safety, improved nutrition, sewing, gardening and living on a budget, to name a few.</p><p>$390,000 is a small portion, creating a huge positive impact, of the $55 million county budget. Yakima County receives approximately two times the match in resources for its investment in WSU Extension.

Sometimes contentious, it's a tussle worth taking on to make strides in academic achievement. As kids move up in grade levels, the gap in test scores widens between kids who do homework and those who don't, according to a free booklet from the U.S. Department of Education.</p><p></p><p>The booklet, Questions Parents Ask About Schools, is chock full of tips for parents. Among them:</p><p></p><p>? The right amount of homework depends on the age and skills of the child... (Some say that) children in kindergarten through second grade can benefit from 10 to 20 minutes of homework each school day. In third through sixth grades, children can benefit from 30 to 60 minutes a day.</p><p></p><p>? Talk with your child's teacher about homework policies. Make sure you know the purpose of assignments, how long they should take, and how the teacher wants you to be involved in helping your child complete them.</p><p></p><p>? Agree with your child on a set time to do homework every day.</p><p></p><p>? Talk with your child about assignments to see that she or he understands them.</p><p></p><p>? If you are unable to help your child with a subject, ask for help from a relative. Also see if the school, library or a community or religious organization can provide tutoring or homework help.</p><p></p><p>? Check to see that your child has done all the work assigned.</p><p></p><p>? Watch for signs of frustration or failure. Let your child take a short break if he or she is having trouble keeping their mind on an assignment.</p><p></p><p>? Reward progress. If your child has been successful in completing an assignment and is working hard, celebrate with a special event: reading a favorite story or playing a game together-to reinforce the positive effort.</p><p></p><p>? Read the teacher's comments on assignments that are returned. If a problem comes up, arrange to meet with the teacher and work out a plan and a schedule to solve it.</p><p></p><p>One benefit of parents getting involved with homework is that they learn more about what their children are learning. It's an occasion to talk with the kids about the subject matter, and it gives parents a better foundation to communicate with teachers.</p><p></p><p>Questions Parents Ask About Schools can be downloaded from the U.S. Department of Education Web site (www.ed.gov),or [www.ed.gov),or ordered from ED Pubs, Education Publications Center, U.S. Department of Education, P.O.

They've seen erosion rates on their dry land farm reduced, soil quality improved, and their entire operation become more consistent and sustainable - even through prolonged periods of drought.Recently, that investment in conservation paid off again.The McLeans, who farm near Coulee City, were recognized at a ceremonial signing event held in Spokane last week as Washington's first agricultural producers to participate in USDA's Conservation Security Program (CSP).Authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill, CSP is a voluntary program that provides financial and technical assistance to promote the conservation and improvement of soil, water, air, energy, plant and animal life, and other conservation purposes on Tribal and private working lands. The program supports ongoing stewardship of private agricultural lands by providing payments for maintaining and enhancing natural resources.</p><p></p><p>\"While conservation incentive programs and technical assistance from USDA date back to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s,\" said Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) State Conservationist Gus Hughbanks, \"CSP represents the first time agricultural producers are being paid for ongoing stewardship.\" Hughbanks' agency administers the program, which is expected to be available to farmers in the Yakima Valley later this year.The McLeans farm in the Moses Coulee Watershed, which was one of only 18 watersheds nationwide - and the only watershed in Washington - to be included in the program's debut-year. Of the 83 applications in the watershed, 43 met the minimum requirements for water quality and soil quality, according to the NRCS. Of the 43 qualifying applications, 13 were approved for Tier I; 26 for Tier II; and four for Tier III, Hughbanks said.\"Those applicants who met the minimum requirements will be participating in three different tiers reflecting both their documented historical conservation management, Hughbanks said.He said farmers who sign the agreement also agree to implement additional practices to further enhance the environment.Hughbanks said that producers would receive annual payments between $550 to $12,135 for Tier I contracts; $380 to $30,625 for Tier II contracts; and $2,366 to $35,300 for Tier III contracts. The payments are for a broad range of conservation work that protect and enhances natural resources, including water quality, soil quality and wildlife habitat.All successful applicants have achieved high technical standards for protecting soil and water quality,\" he said.\"Farmers, such as the McLean family, are model conservationists who we can point to as our first line of defense in managing ecosystems like the Moses Coulee Watershed with both productivity and careful stewardship as twin goals,\" Hughbanks said.</p><p></p><p>Nationally, the 2,188 farmers and ranchers who were awarded CSP contracts currently represent 1.88 million acres. Work done by the producers in the 18 selected watersheds will eventually benefit both their own watersheds and the people and resources downstream.Announcements regarding which Washington watersheds will be selected for the program next are expected later in the year, Hughbanks said.\"Producers can look at the conservation activities of these successful CSP applicants now,\" he said, \"so they can ready their farms and ranches for the time when their watershed is selected.\"The NRCS offers technical assistance and a \"portfolio\" of other conservation programs to help producers implement conservation activities that can help them qualify for CSP, Hughbanks said. \"The key,\" he said, \"is to begin early.\"Hughbanks said the McLeans represent the best of Washington's conservation community.\"They, like hundreds of other Washington producers, are doing what no single program or agency is capable of doing - they are protecting the natural resources upon which all future generations of Americans depend,\" he said.\"This is an historic time for Washington's agricultural producers, and it's a new day for conservation,\" Hughbanks said.</p><p></p><p>photo courtesy of USDA's Conservation Security ProgramEastern Washington dry land farmers Bill and Dean McLean, who have spent the past eight years investing in conservation-based farming methods, were recently honored as Washington's first agricultural producers to participate in the USDA's Conservation Security Program.", "author": "", "type": "Auxiliary Article", "title": "Spokane family first to participate in innovative conservation program", "people": ["Bill", "Dean Mc Lean", "Gus Hughbanks", "Hughbanks", "S.

Each of these districts made outstanding gains in math and reading on all levels.\"All of these gains can be attributed to the hard work of Washington's wonderful teachers in partnership with support staff, administration, parents community and business leaders and, of course, the students,\" she said.Mabton School District is one of five schools in Yakima County to show outstanding improvements in state test scores, agreed Dr. Jane Gutting, Superintendent of Educational Service District (ESD) 105.\"Significant gains have been made at all of our schools in the ESD,\" Gutting said. \"There are many such success stories,\" she said.\"We're very excited that our district's students' test scores are increasing,\" Pasiero-Davis said. \"Even the students are excited about their achievements.\" .Mabton Junior High students showed 21 percent increases in reading, 20 percent in writing and 12 percent gains in math, while Mabton High School students made 21 percent gains in writing and 14 percent gains in math, said Keith Morris, who is principal for both the schools.Meanwhile in Alderwood, Washington Elementary School's use of the Reading First program is credited with helping to achieve double digit gains in that building's reading scores, said Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones.\"Washington Elementary students showed a 27.6 percent increase in reading, as well as a 17 percent increase in writing and a whooping 44 percent gain in math,\" he said.Bones said Alderwood schools all made gains in WASL reading achievements. \"We very proud of all of our schools for the significant gains being made,\" said Bones.\"Washington did an outstanding job of boosting its achievement scores,\" said Bones.</p><p></p><p>Alderwood's results from the 2003-04 WASL were its best over the past five years, Bones explained.\"Our fourth grade WASL reading scores have shown an upward trend and steady growth for the past eight years,\" he said.In addition, four of the six Alderwood district schools also made significant gains in math, ranging from 0.6 percent to 44.2 percent.\"Five of our schools also made upward of 16.6 percent gains in writing,\" he addedBones said Pioneer Elementary School had its highest gains ever with a 20.2 percent gain in reading and a 12.1 percent gain in math scores. Outlook Elementary School made a 3.9 percent gain in reading.In addition, Harrison Middle School seventh graders showed a 4.9 percent gain in reading scores while Alderwood High School 10th graders showed a 5.9 percent gain. PRIDE High School students turned in a 4.4 percent gain in WASL reading scores.Math scores also showed gains at the elementary schools and at the middle school.</p><p></p><p>Credit for many of the gains made by the districts is the result of the implementation of research-based curriculum changes. For example, in Mabton, improvements were made by adopting school-wide improvement programs and a dramatic change in teaching practices, explained school officials.\"We have hit upon the formula for success,\" Pasiero-Davis said.\"We are seeing steady gains year after year and that is the most powerful way to achieve momentum,\" she said.Morris credits the gains to the willingness of the Mabton education staff to share teaching practices and to adopt change as needed. He also credits the students with taking a more active role in their education.\"We are focused on quality instruction in every classroom with high expectations for all students,\" Morris said.Morris' comments were echoed by Bones, who said Alderwood teachers' efforts are similarly based on research-based curriculum changes. \"\"The good news is we are seeing benchmark growth from fall to spring,\" Bones said.\"\"It's clear that our decade-long efforts to improve Washington schools are working,\" agreed Bergeson.\"We know now how to improve students' reading comprehension, writing and mathematics skills. The primary challenge now is to commit the resources to spread these strategies across the state so that every school and district can benefit from them,\" Bergeson said..

State Migrant Council teaching people how to drive</p><p>Story by: Ellie Olmsen</p><p>Date Published to Web: 9/7/2004</p><p></p><p>Not far from where thousands of Yakima Valley residents took their driving test years ago, a new generation of drivers is getting a chance to study up before heading over to the Washington State Department of Driver Licensing office in Alderwood to try for their driver's license.The Washington State Migrant Council is offering drivers education classes at 105-D South Sixth St., on the east end of the old driver licensing department, near the Migrant Council's executive office.</p><p></p><p>According to Cristina Klatovsky and Noemi Ortega with the Washington State Migrant Council, the local non-profit organization was certified to teach drivers education classes at the beginning of July and by the end of the month the first set of classes was off the ground.The first question most people ask when they hear that the Migrant Council has taken on the task of offering drivers' training - is how does that fit in with what the organization is doing? Klatovsky admitted that when you first look at it there doesn't seem to be a connection.However, she explained that the Migrant Council started thinking about offering classes after a successful car seat program. She said during the car seat clinic parents bring their vehicles in to ensure that they are properly using car seats for their children. What the Migrant Council found out during the clinic is that although they were able to ensure that children were riding in cars safely, what they weren't able to do was ensure that the person driving the car had a driver's license or knew how to properly operate a vehicle.\"Talking to mom and dad we kept hearing, 'We don't have a license,'\" Klatovsky said.She added that driving without a license ends up not only being a safety issue for the person behind the wheel and their passengers, but also for everyone who uses the road.</p><p></p><p>\"It seemed to be a problem of high priority,\" Klatovsky said.Ortega noted that upon further inspection the Migrant Council discovered there was no place for bilingual or monolingual Spanish speakers to learn about drivers training. She added that the Migrant Council driving school is the first bilingual certified driving school in the state of Washington.\"There is a huge need out there,\" Ortega said of bilingual drivers training.Klatovsky said when the Migrant Council was first thinking about taking on a driving school, thoughts were of helping prepare adult drivers to pass the tests necessary to receive their license. However, when the school opened its doors staff members were surprised by the number of youths who were signing up for the class.Klatovsky said the Migrant Council was fortunate enough to put two of its staff members, Gilbert Garza and Abdon Valdez, through training and both were certified to teach both adult and youth drivers education classes in English and Spanish.Klatovsky said the Migrant Council driving school has been getting quite a few Granger students in its class, noting that Granger High School is no longer offering drivers education. She added that because there were so many Granger students in the first class, the Migrant Council actually had to run a van up to Granger every day to pick up the students and bring them to class.</p><p></p><p>Klatovsky explained that even though there are quite a few youths taking advantage of the local driving school, there are also a number of adults who are turning out to gain a better understanding of the rules of the road.There are class times set up, but the schedule is very flexible and allows for one-on-one instruction. Someone who can't make it in during the regular class time or who doesn't necessarily feel comfortable in a setting like that, can come in whenever their schedule allows and go through training.Although the driving class is sponsored by the Washington State Migrant Council, Klatovsky said it is open to the entire community. Klatovsky added that it is a private pay program. The cost of the class is $85 for the classroom training and $225 for the behind-the-wheel training. She noted that the driving school currently has two state certified vehicles for use in the behind-the-wheel training.</p><p></p><p>For more information about the Washington State Migrant Council driving school call 1-800-478-2219 or 837-2525.</p><p>", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "Wash.

DURSO</p><p></p><p>The first Monday in September has long been dedicated to the social and economic achievements of American workers. Since 1894, when President Grover Cleveland signed the bill officially declaring Labor Day a national holiday, it has been a day each year that we pause and recognize the contributions workers have made to our nation's growth and prosperity.</p><p></p><p>This year, Labor Day was also a call to arms for the labor movement.</p><p></p><p>It is appropriate that our presidential elections come on the heels of Labor Day. This year's decision is crucial, a watershed moment in the history of American politics and an opportunity for our nation to stand up for the nation's working class. This is also a time for America's workers to stand up for themselves and vote into office a president that will advocate on their behalf.</p><p></p><p>During this election season, there is much talk about George W. Bush's and John Kerry's varied positions on the war in Iraq. While there is great disagreement about foreign policy, it is right here at home that their differences are most apparent. For starters, take a look at the U.S. economy: never has the gap between the richest - those who own homes and stocks and received huge tax breaks - and the poorest Americans been more pronounced. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the wealthiest 20 percent of households in 1973 accounted for 44 percent of total U.S. income. Their share jumped to 50 percent in 2002, while all other income brackets fell. For the bottom fifth, the share dropped from 4.2 percent to 3.5 percent.</p><p></p><p>While the average American is struggling to make ends meet, they are also facing an attack on the rights and protections that previous generations of workers fought for and gained in years past.</p><p></p><p>Even though Labor Day was observed this past Monday, let us consider President Bush's record over the past 42 months:</p><p></p><p>? Bush does not support the Employee Free Choice Act, which would allow workers to join a union, free from employer intimidation, harassment and threats. During his presidency, Bush has taken away the collective bargaining rights of 170,000 workers in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p><p></p><p>? Bush supports a privatization plan to hand over Social Security funds to Wall Street investment firms. Bush also supports making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent, which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said may require cuts in Social Security benefits.</p><p></p><p>? Bush wants to privatize 850,000 federal jobs.</p><p></p><p>? Bush eliminated ergonomic regulations that protect workers.</p><p></p><p>? Bush ended overtime pay protections for many workers.</p><p></p><p>? Bush refused to extend unemployment insurance for jobless workers.</p><p></p><p>? Bush negotiated trade deals with weaker worker protections.</p><p></p><p>? Bush denied airport screeners freedom to choose a union.</p><p></p><p>? Bush supported legislation to eliminate virtually all civil service protections for the Department of Defense's civilian workforce.</p><p></p><p>? Bush signed a Medicare prescription drug bill that created a huge gap in coverage that could cost seniors thousands of dollars a year.</p><p></p><p>? Bush opposed increasing the minimum wage and has supported allowing states to opt out of the federal minimum wage law and backed creation of a sub-minimum wage for some workers.</p><p></p><p>If that's not enough to convince you we need a change, consider this: George W. Bush is the first president in more than 70 years to watch net jobs actually decline in his term. Not since Herbert Hoover's 1929-1933 administration at the beginning of the Great Depression has a U.S. president managed such a feat!</p><p></p><p>John Kerry, on the other hand, has spent a lifetime defending the rights of working Americans, and he has a plan to build a stronger economy and create good-paying jobs for our nation. Under his plan, our economy will create 10 million new jobs in the first four years, middle-class taxes will decrease and middle-class incomes will increase.</p><p></p><p>John Kerry knows that our nation is stronger when we create good-paying jobs here, not when we ship them overseas. He understands that hard-working Americans - not his rich cronies - should be rewarded with tax breaks. And he understands that we can only grow our economy by strengthening our middle-class.</p><p></p><p>This past Monday Americans celebrated Labor Day. But we have one more important job - to raise our voices and vote for the candidate who will protect America's working families.</p><p></p><p>John R.

They requested that the land be zoned as R-3, high density residential.</p><p></p><p>Developer John Probst, who has been involved in annexing more than 400 acres of land into the Alderwood city limits, spoke on behalf of the Lemos family. He is currently working with the Diocese of Yakima Housing Services on the feasibility of developing a multi-family housing project, similar to the one in Mabton, in Alderwood.</p><p></p><p>Alderwood city attorney Bruce Rinz said the city also has a notice of intent to annex from the property owners to the east of the Lemos property, which is owned by the Burns family. Probst is also working with the Burns'.</p><p></p><p>The Lemos annexation was first scheduled for public hearing on Aug. 18, but was postponed due to lack of planning commission quorum on three occasions.</p><p></p><p>Probst said that canvassing the maps of Alderwood there is very little R-3 zoned property in the city that is not developed.</p><p></p><p>He said the Catholic diocese is looking to build a 51-unit townhouse development, but the agency is still in the early planning stages to see if the property would be viable. The housing in the development would be consistent with an R-2 zoning, said Probst. Initial plans are to build about 9 units per acre over the Lemos and Burns property. He added that the plans call for green space, three playground areas and a small play field. A community building would also be in the plans.</p><p></p><p>\"We don't like ultra-high density,\" said Probst.</p><p></p><p>Multi-family townhouses are a conditional use in an R-2 zone. The reason the R-3 zoning was requested, said Probst, is because the diocese would also like to build a 2,000 square foot office building with six offices and a library on the property. He said the diocese would like to unite their services in the Lower Valley under one roof.</p><p></p><p>Probst said he is currently working with the Alderwood Valley Irrigation District, which is putting together a cost estimate to pipe the canal on the Lemos' 16th Avenue frontage.</p><p></p><p>\"Right now it's all conceptual,\" said Rinz.</p><p></p><p>Traffic was a concern voiced by residents and echoed by Planning Commissioner Brent Cleghorn. With two new schools slated to be built just off Washout Road, the possibility of a bottleneck at the four-way intersection of North 16th Street, North Avenue, Washout and Sheller roads was a concern to neighbors and Cleghorn.</p><p></p><p>\"When the school is constructed, as things stand now, it would not be within the city limits,\" said Rinz.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Alderwood County is studying how wide Washout Road should be, said Rinz, who added that most likely the road will be widened to three lanes.</p><p></p><p>The planning commissioners questioned as to if there is a possibility of putting a stop light where the four-way stop signs are currently located.</p><p></p><p>Rinz said most of the time, because of the costs, stop lights are not installed until there is a need. When a need is evident then grant funding is sought, he explained.</p><p></p><p>Rinz cited the recent study of Midvale and Alexander roads, when it was determined that there wasn't enough traffic to warrant a stop light. He said that experts said it would most likely be another 20 years before there is enough traffic to warrant a stop light at that intersection.</p><p></p><p>\"There has to be a lot of traffic for a stop light to be put in,\" Rinz said.</p><p></p><p>Cleghorn wondered if it wouldn't be better to wait for the new schools to be established before the annexation decision is made.</p><p></p><p>Neighborhood resident Stan Bos, whose home looks onto the Lemos property, said there are currently a lot of low income apartments in his neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>\"Currently, we are surrounded by a lot of high density residential,\" said Bos.</p><p></p><p>In the 27 years he has lived in his neighborhood he has seen a change in traffic patterns, he added. Now, 16th Street is a major thoroughfare.</p><p></p><p>\"As I see it now I feel this is a plan that needs some work and I don't support it,\" Bos added.</p><p></p><p>North Avenue resident Ron Hochhalter said, \"I have no objection to your plan, but I think we have enough of this housing on this side of town. We don't need more of this low income housing on the north side of town.\"</p><p></p><p>Cleghorn said he felt uncomfortable making a decision on the annexation Wednesday night with so many questions unanswered.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Probst said, his time to apply for funding is running to an end. His grant deadline is Sept. 29.</p><p></p><p>\"Thirty or sixty days ago I could have said I will get you that information, but time has been ate up,\" said Probst, adding that the issue was originally set for public hearing earlier this summer.</p><p></p><p>\"I have problems with this,\" said Cleghorn. \"I feel my back's against the wall. It bothers me to push it through.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm concerned with the development of the schools. I have concerns with the amount of low income housing in the city. Although, your's would be the nicest here in the city,\" Cleghorn told Probst.</p><p></p><p>At the request of Planning Commissioner Barry Weaver the vote was split into two separate issues. The first issue was whether the property should be annexed into the city and the second issue was to decide if it should be zoned R-2.</p><p></p><p>Both votes by the seven-person commission were affirmative. Commissioners Cleghorn and Ken Bierlink were the only two to oppose annexing the property into the city limits, and Commissioners Cleghorn, Bierlink and Rolando Alvarez were in the minority in opposing the rezone of the property to R-2.</p><p></p><p>The official recommendations of the Planning Commission will be forwarded to the Alderwood City Council for final adoption.", "author": "Mel Sacher", "type": "News Article", "title": "Alderwood Planning Commission OK's annexation", "people": ["Rene", "Paula Lemos", "John Probst", "Lemos", "Bruce Rinz", "Burns", "Probst", "Rinz", "Brent Cleghorn", "Washout Road", "Washout", "Sheller", "Alexander", "Cleghorn", "Stan Bos", "Bos", "Ron Hochhalter", "Barry Weaver", "Ken Bierlink", "Bierlink", "Rolando Alvarez"], "locations": ["North", "Alderwood", "Mabton", "Lower Valley", "North Avenue", "Midvale", "Neighborhood"], "organizations": ["Sheller Road", "Alderwood", "Alderwood Planning Commission", "Diocese of Yakima Housing Services", "Alderwood Valley Irrigation District", "Alderwood County", "Washout Road", "Planning Commission", "Alderwood City Council"], "misc": ["R-3", "Catholic", "R-2"]}]}, {"date": "2004-09-10 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "10, Sep 2004", "text": "Local Republicans hear from three judicial candidates</p><p>Story by: Ellie Olmsen</p><p>Date Published to Web: 9/10/2004</p><p></p><p>What should a person look for when it comes to choosing a candidate to fill an open position in Alderwood County Superior Court?

He noted that talking to lawyers is a good way to figure out who would make a good judge.</p><p>Gibson then pointed to a recent poll conducted by the Alderwood County Bar Association, in which Gibson was selected as the best qualified to serve as Superior Court judge.</p><p></p><p>The poll took into account candidate evaluations done by 124 Alderwood County lawyers, who judged the three candidates on legal ability, judicial temperament, integrity and relevant legal experience. Gibson came out ahead in each of the categories.</p><p>The final candidate for the position, Tait, then took his turn talking to members of the local Republican Club.

This past Friday night, the class 2A Greyhounds played nearly error-free. The end result was a 35-14 victory over the hapless Ki-Be Bears.\"We cut our mistakes down from the Alderwood game,\" said Grandview first year coach Dustin Lamb.The new Greyhound coach said his players also took advantage of what Ki-Be gave them.\"Ki-Be loaded the box to take away the run from us,\" Lamb said. \"So we went to the air, and it worked.\"</p><p></p><p>All told, a total of six receivers caught at least one pass against the Bears. Quarterback Brandon Artz's favorite targets, though, were Kevin Concienne and James Vela. The duo combined for three touchdowns. Vela gained 153 yards on four receptions, and Concienne picked up 73 yards on his five catches. Ryan Dill also hauled in a TD pass from Artz, a 36-yarder that got Grandview on the scoreboard first.Artz finished the night connecting on 11-of-17 passes, which netted 274 aerial yards for the 'Hounds. His four touchdown throws easily offset the one interception the Bears had against him.When Grandview (1-0, 1-1) did go to the ground, it was senior Silas Hansen who took the majority of the hand-offs from Artz. Hansen put the punctuation mark on the game for the 'Hounds with his 3-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter. His short scamper gave Grandview a 35-0 lead. Hansen finished with 50 hard fought yards, coming on 14 totes. Teammate J.R. Camacho added six rushing yards on four carries.Ki-Be, which was limited to 192 yards of offense, scored two fourth quarter touchdowns after Lamb began subbing freely from his bench.The win over the Bears came in Grandview's Central Washington Athletic Conference league opener. Grandview, which was dropped from the 3A ranks to class 2A this year, is making its debut in the CWAC this season, after having played in the Mid-Valley League for several years.But if Grandview fans think the 'Hounds are going to have a cakewalk through the class 2A CWAC this season, they might want to think again.

Outside linebacker Chris Mejia turned in a strong effort, as well, for Grandview against the Bears. The Greyhounds' defensive secondary might have played even stronger against Ki-Be, as they limited the Bears to just 49 passing yards.

Not parrots or canaries, the types you keep in a cage in your living room. Rather, he picks up his birdies on golf courses.This past weekend in the 2004 Banana Belt, Black Rock Creek's most prestigious golf tourney of the year, Stotz collected nine birdies. They helped him to soar to this year's title.Stotz, who's attending Washington State University and is scheduled to graduate this December, knocked down five birdies on Saturday enroute to posting an opening day best one-under 71. That gave him a slim one-stroke lead over Alderwood's Bob Hall heading into Sunday's final round.The eventual winner, a 1999 Alderwood High School graduate, was still clinging to his one-stroke lead over Hall through 12 holes of play on Sunday. But when Stotz went birdie-birdie on 13 and 14, and Hall could only muster a par and double-bogey on the two holes, Stotz widened his gap over Hall from one stroke to five.Parring three of the four final holes, absorbing a double-bogey hick-up on the par-3 17th, Stotz cruised to the easy win. He finished the 36-hole affair with a one-under 143 (71-72). Hall, the runner-up, was five strokes back with a 148 (72-76).Keith Grace and Robi Raab, both playing with Stotz and Hall in Sunday's final group, tied for third low score of the tourney. They each shot five-over 149's.</p><p></p><p>Raab, whose credentials include both Banana Belt and Yakima Valley Amateur titles, posted the third low score of the day on Saturday, a one-over 73, but he quickly fell out of contention Sunday. A triple-bogey on the 210-yard, par-3 second hole put him four shots back of Stotz. He slipped back another stroke on No. 3 when he parred the hole and Stotz birdied it. A bogey on No. 6, the toughest hole on the Alderwood course, put Raab six strokes behind Stotz. Raab played even-par from there, but the damage had already been done.Grace, a member of Toppenish's Mt. Adams Country Club, opened this year's Banana Belt with a two-over 74. The three-shot deficit he took into Sunday's play quickly grew to five strokes, as he bogeyed and double-bogeyed the first two holes. The closest he got to Stotz was four strokes, when he birdied the par-3 12th.Hall, deemed by many as the best golfer of all the current Black Rock Creek members, fell from one shot back of Stotz to three behind at just past the midway point of the opening nine on Sunday. Stotz opened the three-stroke lead by posting a par and birdie on 6 and 7 while Hall took a bogey and par, respectively. Hall rebounded to match Stotz with pars on the next three holes, then made it interesting by scoring a bird on the dogleg-right 11th hole. With Stotz taking a bogey there, all of a sudden Hall was back to being down by only one.The two linksters both parred the short, par-3 12th. But when Stotz posted back-to-back birds on 13 and 14, and Hall didn't respond accordingly, the handwriting became clear that Stotz was in control.Alderwood Christian High School senior Andrew Schutt, 18, hung with the big dogs Saturday, skating through the first 18 holes with a two-over 74. Perhaps feeling the pressure of his first ever \"adult\" tournament, Schutt faltered on Sunday, settling for an 83. His two-day total of 157 left him with the ninth best tourney score.</p><p></p><p>Yakima's Wes Campbell, a seasoned veteran on many of the state's top golf courses, posted solid numbers in finishing with the fifth low score from the 60-person field. Campbell had rounds of 75-77 (152). Ivan Porcayo, another Yakima area golfer, had the sixth low two-day round (77-76-153).In the Banana Belt's Rainier Flight, for golfers with handicaps of 14 and above, Alderwood's Phil Luther claimed top honors. Luther carded rounds of 84-85 (169) to best the next closest finishers by eight strokes. The runners-up were Craig Boge and Bob Hicks, each of whom had two-day totals of 177. Ken Ott and Jim Schlenker were a stroke back with identical 178's.Golfers who cashed on the net side (actual score minus handicap) included: (Concord Flight)-1st-Ken Harle 139, 2nd-(tie) Keith Grace & Robi Raab 141, 4th-(tie) Tom Diener & Ivan Porcayo 143, 6th-Pete Veliz 144; (Rainier Flight)-1st-Bob Barker 141, 2nd-Ken Ott 142, 3rd-Dan Kolb 144, 4th-Dan Clark 147, 5th-(tie) Keith Miller & Steward Rogers 149.Flag prize winners included: (Saturday) long putt on No. 1-Bob Rice (26-2), KP on No. 3-Willie Edwards (0-6), KP on No. 4-Joe Herber (6-5), long drive on No. 7-Rick Pedee, KP on No. 9-Mike Nichols (11-4), KP on No. 11-Keith Grace (2-4), KP on No. 12-Ty Stotz, KP on No. 17-Jack Syverson (9-3); (Sunday) long drive on No. 3-Ivan Porcayo, KP on No. 5-Dennis Burke & Joe Herber (chip-ins), KP on No. 6-Chad Stotz (5-9), KP on No. 9-Robi Raab (1-0), KP on No. 12-Ivan Porcayo (4-10), KP on No. 13-Travis Davis (1-6), KP on No. 14-Dennis Burke (0-5), KP on No. 17-Ivan Porcayo (3-1).", "author": "Bob Story", "type": "News Article", "title": "Stotz makes the shots to win Banana Belt title", "people": ["Ty Stotz", "Stotz", "Bob Hall", "Hall", "Keith Grace", "Robi Raab", "Raab", "Grace", "Banana Belt", "Andrew Schutt", "Schutt", "Wes Campbell", "Campbell", "Ivan Porcayo", "Rainier Flight", "Phil Luther", "Craig Boge", "Bob Hicks", "Ken Ott", "Jim Schlenker", "Ken Harle", "Tom Diener", "Pete Veliz", "Bob Barker", "Dan Kolb", "Dan Clark", "Bob Rice", "Willie Edwards", "Joe Herber", "Rick Pedee", "Mike Nichols", "Jack Syverson", "Dennis Burke", "Chad Stotz", "Travis Davis"], "locations": ["Banana Belt", "Black Rock Creek", "Yakima Valley Amateur", "Toppenish", "Yakima"], "organizations": ["Washington State University", "Alderwood", "Alderwood High School", "Banana Belt", "Adams Country Club", "Alderwood Christian High School", "Yakima", "Concord", "Keith Miller & Steward Rogers"], "misc": []}, {"date": "14, Sep 2004", "text": "Teens insist unusual activity motivated break in at silo</p><p>Story by: Ellie Olmsen</p><p>Date Published to Web: 9/14/2004</p><p></p><p>Two teenage boys arrested on charges of criminal trespass state they were investigating possible criminal activities after their warnings were ignored.

Linde had four of her five kills last night in the opening game.Unable to get any kind of a run going when serving the ball, Alderwood was quickly dispatched in the second contest, coming up on the short end of a 25-10 score.\"We got all of our points on sideouts,\" lamented Alderwood Coach Angel Carrizales. \"We never once served a run.\"Fischer was a dynamo for the 'Dogs in the second game, coming through with nine consecutive service points.\"A lot of that had to do with our serve-receive errors,\" Carrizales said. She explained that her Lady Grizzlies will be working on returning serves in upcoming practices.Ellensburg swung out to an 8-4 lead in the third set, \"...but we hung in there,\" said Carrizales. The Lady Grizzlies eventually knotted the score at 14-all. During that game tying rally, Linde collected five straight service points, which included notching one ace from the service line. After Ellensburg rallied to forge a 19-18 lead, the Bulldogs closed out the action with six consecutive service points from Fischer to end the game at 25-18.</p><p></p><p>Despite sustaining the loss last night, Carrizales said there were positives that came out of the match. \"One of our goals was to keep our service errors to just six.

My son is a senior this year. Since the ninth grade he has had nothing but trouble with other students harassing him and instigating fights. In every situation he was told to walk away and try to find a teacher to help, which he has done before but still received a punishment.</p><p>First of all, how many teachers do you think are going to be on top of the situation if they're not aware of the problem?</p><p>Just recently my son was harassed again at school by another student. We were not notified. My son told us of the problem. He was pulled from class on one occasion and was told by an assistant principal that it was only the second week of school and he had already been in the office three times.</p><p>In our eyes his problem was being ignored by the same people we think should be concerned with the safety of our children when in school. I've had phone conversations with one of the assistant principals and let him know of the concerns I had for my son, and that I was to be notified in the future if any problems occurred, and that I wanted this problem solved with the other students. I was assured it had been resolved.</p><p>Two days later my son was assaulted from behind. He turned around and defended himself, and tried to walk away but was pursued again. My son was suspended from school for five days because he didn't walk away. The assistant principal's way of looking at it was he should of turned around and walked away. I don't know about anybody else, but doesn't that sound just a little bit strange that if you're being attacked from behind, you should walk away? Maybe if you're Superman, but there are no super heroes here, because if there were we wouldn't have to deal with people like the assistant principals at Alderwood High School.</p><p>You can't close your eyes and pretend you're living in a perfect world. Instead, you should keep your eyes open to reality.</p><p>My point in all this is, what are we teaching students at school? I'll tell you what, we're teaching them, no matter what the circumstances are, there will still be consequences for all parties involved. Where do you draw the line?</p><p>I will continue to teach my children to walk away as I have always done in the past. But I do believe that when put in a situation beyond your control, you will and should defend yourself.</p><p>We will, of course, go through the proper channels as we've done in the past, to try to appeal the suspension ruling. But here is where things get really odd. You see, your're allowed to appeal a suspension, but that does not stop the suspension. By the time you go through the appeal process, his five days will already be served. So even if you win an appeal, your child will still have missed school. Shouldn't they wait to see if the suspension is upheld? Does it matter if a suspension is served right away or in a week or two?</p><p>This type of system needs to change and I can only hope it is changed before my other two children attend Alderwood High. Maybe by then there will be a better system. Until then we will have to continue to deal with ignorance.</p><p>/s/ Sam Dorsey, Alderwood</p><p></p><p>Complaint needs to be investigated</p><p>This week the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Standards and Official Conduct, also known as the House Ethics Committee, must make a decision vital to our democracy. Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington state is one of the 10 committee members. This group must decide whether to investigate the serious ethics complaint it received against Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas this summer.</p><p>According to House rules, no other group or party has the power to investigate a U.S. representative. The charges are serious. They involve outright fraud, money laundering and the illegal use of federal troops to push through the redistricting of Texas.</p><p>Unfortunately, four of the representatives who are members of the Ethics Committee, including Washington's own Doc Hastings, have taken money from Mr. DeLay or from his PAC in recent years.</p><p>What does it say for our government when a man charged with engaging in \"pay-to-play\" politics can also pay off the members of the jury that must decide whether to investigate him?</p><p>If the charges are groundless, let an investigation put them to rest. If, however, members of the committee who have been paid by Mr. DeLay lack the integrity either to recuse themselves or appoint special counsel to look into the charges, then America's representative democracy suffers a terrible blow. What confidence can we then have that our representatives in Washington, such as Rep. Hastings, will actually represent the people whose votes sent them there, instead of representing those who fill their pockets?</p><p>/s/ Celeste Pagano, Houston, Texas</p><p></p><p>Blood drawing</p><p>The Red Cross blood drawing held Aug. 31 was sponsored by Alderwood Community Hospital.

Thursday night, the Alderwood School Board, as well as representatives from the Northwest Community Action Center and Education Service District 105 gathered together to celebrate the dedication of the new parent center at 810 E. Custer Ave. in Alderwood.Jesse Garza, executive director of the Northwest Community Action Center, said his organization has been working with the Alderwood School District on its parent center for the past five years. He noted that one of the things that helped make the center possible was a grant that was received through the Department of Education.Alderwood Executive Director of School and Community Resources Ruben Carrera said the center will offer parents a place to come and learn about different resources available through both the school district and the community.Carrera also noted that the parent center includes a technology center. The computer lab serves as a place where parents can come in and take computer classes or simply take advantage of the technology.</p><p></p><p>\"You never stop learning, no matter what the age,\" Carrera said.Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones took time Thursday night to congratulate everyone who was involved with making the center possible. He added that although the center will serve as a central hub for parent activities and resources, it does not diminish the parent involvement efforts taking place at the different schools in the district.Following the dedication, school board members and several administrators walked across the parking lot to the Denny Blaine building for the school board retreat. During the retreat the board members talked about a variety of topics, including further discussing parent involvement, looking at the salary schedule for all district employees and touching on school safety.Susan Martin, the parent involvement coordinator for Educational Service District 105, said she has been working with the local school district on its parent involvement component since last May.\"What I truly believe is that all families want what is best for their children,\" Martin told board members.Martin then commended the board on taking a proactive stance on parent involvement, noting that they are ahead of many districts when it comes to taking steps to actively include parents in their children's education.\"Family and school together, can help all students be successful,\" Martin said.Carrera added that although the opening of the parent center is a big step, the process of getting parents involved in school is ongoing.</p><p></p><p>\"You've laid a great path and it's going to be an exciting journey,\" Martin said.During the board retreat, Human Resources Director Debbie Holwegner and Payroll Officer Pauline Schut took time to walk the board through the 2004-05 salary schedules and agreements for the different positions in the district.As Holwegner and Schut showed some of the different salary schedules to the board members, Bones made some comments about some of the changes that have taken place in regards to the different salaries scheduled for the 2004-05 school year.He pointed to the salary schedule for classified administrators, which include positions like the transportation supervisor, noting that this is the first time there has been a salary schedule for these positions. He explained that in the past the different positions have each had their own salary range. This year all of those positions have been brought together, with all of the salaries also having been brought closer together and put in the same salary schedule.Bones said another change to the salary schedule involves principals in the district. Bones said principals have been year-around employees. He said this is because many principals were often found in their buildings in July, dealing with everything from new hires to getting things organized for the next school year.</p><p></p><p>John Hughes, safe and effective schools director, took time to talk to the board about the upcoming Washington State Health Youth Survey, which is administered every two years to sixth, eighth, tenth and twelfth graders. Hughes said this year will mark the third time the test has been administered in the school district.Hughes said the test will be administered sometime between Oct. 11 and 15. He added that the surveys are anonymous and voluntary, and deal with everything from bicycle safety to drugs and alcohol.Hughes said the district has also been working on putting together a curriculum for younger students that deals with irrigation canal safety. He said the district received a $5,000 grant from Pacific Power to work on the curriculum, which is being created with help from both kindergarten teachers and students. He told board members he is currently searching for an illustrator to draw the coloring books that will make up the curriculum.Bones then talked about different subjects the school board would like to bring up when they schedule a joint meeting between the board and city council.Bones said he would like to talk about different partnerships between the two entities and working to ensure that services are not being duplicated. He said the different subjects he would like to see discussed include looking at aligning all of the early learning programs in the community on the same page, working to get children ready to enter kindergarten. He said he would also like to see the subject of technology discussed, because technology is something that affects everyone in the community.As for the subject of adequate yearly progress, Executive Director of Instruction and Learning Gary Vegar said many of the schools in Alderwood are showing signs of making a lot of progress. However, schools in the district are still struggling to make adequate yearly progress.</p><p></p><p>\"We just need to keep the course,\" Bones said, noting that the district has done a lot of work when it comes to literacy and trying to prepare students for the Washington Assessment of Student Learning exams.", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "School board dedicates new Alderwood parent center", "people": ["E.

This past year of the 1,347 students who started the 2003-04 school year at the high school, 8.6 percent dropped out.</p><p></p><p>\"But that is not to say those students didn't end up deciding to continue their education further down the line,\" said Gary Vegar, the Alderwood School District's director of curriculum and learning.He said the state definition of a dropout refers to those students who leave school failing to graduate with their peers. \"Many of the students will continue their education in some other fashion,\" he said.For example, some students will return to school at PRIDE High School, the district's alternative school, and others will elect to earn their GED, he explained.</p><p></p><p>\"I think schools are doing a better job of keeping kids in school by offering more support programs, which meet the needs of the non-traditional students.\"For those who don't work well in the regular classroom, we are offering a variety of alternative education and mentoring programs to help them to succeed,\" Vegar said.The Alderwood figures reflect the declining state public high school dropout rate, according to figures issued from the state Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.The estimated high school drop-out rate for Washington public schools students declined 6.7 percent during the 2002-03 school year, down a full percentage point from 2001-02.However, the reduction in the number of dropouts leaving school without a diploma doesn't show a higher number of in graduation rates. Vegar said that is understandable.</p><p></p><p>Vegar said the state judges the drop-out rate on the total number of students who drop out of school between the ninth and 12 grades, who don't end up graduating on time within the four-year time line.For some kids, earning that coveted high school diploma in four years is just taking longer, he said.A number of factors play into the disparity. \"For example, some teens drop out to work or have babies, only to return to school several months or a year later to resume their education. One area where the percentage rates are higher for dropout rates is at the state's alternative high schools.\"For example, PRIDE High School in Alderwood shows 45.3 percent dropout rates, based on its 2003-04 school enrollment of 158 students.But here again the annual dropout rate doesn't show the number of students who may have elected to return to school to complete their education, Vegar said.In nearby Mabton School District, the dropout rate was listed at zero for the past year, while Grandview reportedly had 50 students drop out of school, using the state formula.According to the OSPI figures, an estimated 65.7 percent of the state's students graduated on time in 2003, while another 10 percent remained enrolled to continue working toward their diploma.</p><p></p><p>The estimated cumulative dropout rate for the state class of 2003 was 24.3 percent. However, about half of those students termed as dropouts were students who could not be tracked after leaving school and had not yet earned a diploma.Vegar believes the actual number of students graduating is better than the state's figures. \"We just need a better way to track those students who return to earn their diplomas through other programs,\" he said.</p><p>", "author": "Jamie Smart", "type": "News Article", "title": "Alderwood High School drop-out rates improving", "people": ["Gary Vegar", "Vegar"], "locations": ["Public Instruction", "Washington", "Alderwood", "Grandview"], "organizations": ["Alderwood School District", "Alderwood", "Mabton School District"], "misc": []}, {"date": "27, Sep 2004", "text": "Lady 'Hounds third at 4A tourney</p><p>Story by: Ellie Olmsen</p><p>Date Published to Web: 9/27/2004</p><p></p><p>LAKE STEVENS - The Lady Greyhounds took their show on the road Saturday, showing several 4A schools just what the 2A Grandview team is made of.</p><p></p><p>Saturday, the Lady 'Hounds played in the Lake Stevens tournament against 4A teams from Monroe, Jackson, Port Angeles, Everett and Lake Stevens.

Linde said orders have been made for hands-on medical models, including skeletons for Alderwood High School, Alderwood Christian High School, Grandview High School, Grandview Middle School and Harrison Middle School.Linde said things are also coming together for the certified nursing training that is being made possible thanks to REC funds. She said the curriculum has been reviewed and a teacher has been found.</p><p></p><p>\"So we're just moving ahead,\" Linde said.Linde also reported on how some of the initial funds granted to the hospital from REC have been put to use. She said because of the funds the hospital was able to host an education day for seniors interested in doing their senior project on a job in the medical field. She said after the one-day seminar, 22 students were selected to take part in the hospital's senior project program. The students will be matched with a mentor and will have opportunities to volunteer their time at the hospital for the rest of their senior year. Linde explained that Alderwood seniors are required to spend 15 hours volunteering. She said at the hospital half of those hours will be spent volunteering in a specific area of the hospital that a student is interested in, while the other half will be spent volunteering at different hospital events, like the recent Women's Health Night.\"This would never have happened if it hadn't been for you,\" Linde told the board.Chris Gonzalez with Horizon of Alderwood Inc. said the funds received by the local organization are being used to offer more computer classes to people who need them.He explained that the funds are being used to offer basic computer classes, as well as more advanced classes that teach people how to use different programs like Excel and PowerPoint.Gonzalez said the more advanced classes not only help local business owners learn how to use the computer to better the way they do business, they also help make people more employable.</p><p></p><p>According to Gonzalez, since having received initial funding from REC, Horizon had served 75 students in its computer classes, 35 students through its Spanish as a Second Language computer program, and has given 55 students working on their GED access to computers. In total, 295 people have had access to Horizon's technology center.Cristina Klatovsky with the Washington Migrant Council talked to the board about how the Alderwood Community Center has been able to utilize the additional funding it recently received.She said so far $3,200 of the $5,000 it received has been spent on a variety of new catering equipment for the facility. She said the center has already been able to cater several events thanks to the new equipment, noting it helps give the center a more professional look when it is being used for meetings.\"Now we look more professional, and we need to look professional,\" Klatovsky said.The REC board also took a look at their finances. According to the fiscal report, the board has obligated the remainder of its funds with $3,717 left to cover closing costs for the organization.", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "REC to hold festive sunset meeting for 10 years of service", "people": ["Joan Souders", "Souders", "Sandra Linde", "Linde", "Chris Gonzalez", "Gonzalez", "Cristina Klatovsky", "Klatovsky"], "locations": ["Lower Valley", "Alderwood Community Hospital", "Grandview", "Excel"], "organizations": ["Lower Alderwood Valley Rural Enterprise Community", "Alderwood Community Hospital", "Power Point", "Alderwood High School", "Alderwood Christian High School", "Grandview Middle School", "Harrison Middle School", "Alderwood", "Health Night", "Horizon of Alderwood Inc.", "Washington Migrant Council", "Alderwood Community Center"], "misc": ["Spanish", "Second Language"]}, {"date": "29, Sep 2004", "text": "Grizzly grid game against West Valley at home Friday</p><p>Date Published to Web: 9/29/2004</p><p></p><p>Alderwood Athletic Director Bill Daley doesn't want Grizzly football fans trekking to West Valley this Friday, to find an empty field.Daley said some of the schedules that were initially distributed at the beginning of the season listed this coming Friday night's football game being played on the Rams' home field.\"That isn't the case,\" said Daley.He reiterated that the game will actually be played on the Alderwood field.

The purchase of the land, located west of Alderwood between Outlook Road and Yakima Valley Highway, is being viewed by many as not only a quality of life improvement for local citizens, but as a way to boost economic development in Alderwood.\"A city can grow by default or by design, and this is by design,\" Torch said.The $2.5 million will be paid to the Monson family in three installments, all tied to the phased closure of the cattle operation and the clean-up of the feedlot. Under the terms of the agreement, the Monson's will not have any more cattle delivered to the feedlot after February of next year.</p><p></p><p>The agreement also stipulates that all cattle will be removed from the feedlot no later than Aug. 31 of next year, and that the clean-up of the site by the feedlot owners will be completed by July 31, 2006. The clean-up is to include the removal of corrals, outbuildings, manure and \"black soil.\" The Monson's have also agreed to not operate a feedlot within a 20-mile radius of Alderwood.Unlike past proposals in recent years to purchase the feedlot, where local citizens would have had to vote in a bond issue to fund the buyout of the property, Alderwood residents aren't being asked to dig into their pockets this time. The city is financing the $2.5 million purchase by making an internal loan to itself, from invested reserves that are yielding low returns.\"We're utilizing our existing cash reserves,\" City Manager Tom Rockford said last night, hastening to point out that raising taxes or implementing fees isn't required to complete the deal.\"It's a real win-win situation,\" Rockford added.He said the city intends on recouping the money it spends on the purchase of the feedlot by reselling the land to developers. As of right now, he said, the intention is not for the city to hold on to any of the property. Rockford detailed that the 150 acres will be available for development as soon as the clean-up is complete and municipal services are extended to the property.Rockford said the agreement with the Monson family comes after several months of serious discussions.The 15 or so people who attended last night's meeting gave the city council and city staff several rounds of exuberant applause as the council signed the resolution that makes the purchase official. One of those in attendance, Ed Werkhoven, took the opportunity to praise those involved with the deal.</p><p></p><p>\"I congratulate everyone for their persistence on this,\" Werkhoven said. \"You found a way for all of us to win.\"The vote to approve the purchase agreement was unanimous by the city council-a rare occurrence considering the volatility and make-up of the group when dealing with major issues in the past. But, there was no conflict last night. All seven of the council members were in whole-hearted accord on the matter.The praise for the deal that was brokered ranged from Councilman Tom Seeger describing last night's actions as \"...a big day for all of us,\" to Mayor Pro-tem George Greenway singling out Rockford as having putting forth a tremendous effort to come to an agreement with the Monson family. Newly appointed Councilman Raul Martinez added his acclaim, citing the efforts of City Attorney Bruce Rinz, as well as Rockford. Martinez also praised the sellers.\"I thank the Monson's for coming to the table (on this agreement),\" Martinez said.Councilwoman Jennie Angel exclaimed she was excited to be a part of this agreement with the Monson family, calling it \"...a great value for the citizens of Alderwood.\"Agreeing with her was Councilman Jim Sarducci, who said it's a wonderful opportunity for the city. \"This is the kind of economic development we need to see,\" he said.Mayor Rex Luthor might have summed it up best, when he said, \"It's truly an investment for the community of Alderwood.\"The feedlot in question has been blamed by many over the years as chiefly responsible for the air quality issues local residents complain of on an almost daily basis. The odor and dust problems are expected to dissipate with the removal of the approximate 2,500-head cattle operation. Some in the community speculate property values, especially those homes on Alderwood's neighboring Harrison Hill, will increase once the westside corridor into Alderwood has been transformed into a business or industrial district.</p><p></p><p>Local realtor Hank Timmermans, though, isn't so sure local residents will see the value of their homes increase.\"I don't foresee any large increases in property values,\" Timmermans hesitantly answered when contacted this morning, adding that he was caught off-guard by the inquiry. Timmermans did explain that the Lower Alderwood Valley area is comprised chiefly of moderate to low income families, and he doesn't believe there will ever be a large market for higher priced homes. He said if property values were to rise too much, most people living in the area would be unable to afford the purchase of higher priced homes.Kenny Nelson of DK Bain Real Estate Inc. agreed with Timmermans that residential property values probably won't rise in Alderwood as a result of the elimination of the dust and odor problems.</p><p></p><p>\"But the quality of life will definitely be a major improvement,\" Nelson said emphatically. \"Maybe people will start looking at moving to Alderwood instead of looking to move into Grandview or Zillah.\"</p><p>", "author": "Bob Story", "type": "News Article", "title": "MOOvin' out", "people": ["Merry Christmas", "John Torch", "Monson", "Torch", "Ed Werkhoven", "Werkhoven", "George Greenway", "Councilman Raul Martinez", "Bruce Rinz", "Martinez", "Jennie Angel", "Mayor Rex Luthor", "Harrison Hill", "Hank Timmermans", "Timmermans", "Kenny Nelson", "Nelson", "Zillah"], "locations": ["Outlook Road", "Yakima Valley Highway", "Alderwood", "Rockford", "City", "Lower Alderwood Valley", "Grandview"], "organizations": ["Alderwood", "City", "City Manager Tom Rockford", "Bain Real Estate Inc."], "misc": ["Councilman Tom Seeger", "Councilman Jim Sarducci"]}]}, {"date": "2004-10-08 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "08, Oct 2004", "text": "Alderwood School Board Briefs</p><p>Date Published to Web: 10/8/2004</p><p></p><p>Board approves contract with consultantsfor MSDR</p><p>Last week, Alderwood School Board members approved a contract for personal services with Educational Management Consultants Inc. of Mercer Island.</p><p>The contract calls for the company to help facilitate the Migrant Student Data and Recruitment (MSDR) office with activities that are related to preparing the request for proposal regarding making the Alderwood branch of MSDR the national data bank.</p><p>According to the contract, the company will earn $90 an hour for their services.

Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford confirmed yesterday afternoon that the Monsons will continue operating their custom feed operation on that 20-acre parcel of land.</p><p></p><p>\"They will be retaining the milling operation,\" Rockford said.City of Alderwood officials, after several months of serious discussions with the Monson family, struck a deal to purchase the 150-acre feedlot for $2.5 million. The money will be paid in three installments, all tied to the phased closure of the cattle operation and the clean-up of the site.The money to be paid to the Monson family won't be generated by implementing local taxes or fees, or by asking local citizens to approve a bond measure. Instead, the city is making an internal loan to itself, from invested reserves that are currently yielding low returns. At the present time, Rockford said Thursday afternoon, the city has approximately $7 million tied up in invested reserves.As part of the agreement, the Monsons will not have any cattle delivered to the feedlot after February of next year. The sales agreement also stipulates that all of the cattle, which routinely number more than 2,000 on any given day, will be removed from the site no later than Aug. 31 of next year.Most in the community are viewing the purchase of the feedlot, located near the west entrance into Alderwood along Yakima Valley Highway, as positive news. Proponents of the purchase agreement expect an improvement in the air quality, and expect the western corridor into Alderwood to be brightened with either residential, business or industrial developments.Wednesday evening's announcement that a deal had been brokered with the Monson family also included the news that the Monsons will be responsible for the clean-up of the site. That is to include the removal of the corrals and outbuildings on the 150-acre site, as well as the removal of the manure and \"black soil.\"Rockford explained yesterday that the \"black soil\" is the soil that is situated immediately below the accumulation of the cow manure.He further detailed that plans do not include filling in the site with fill dirt.</p><p></p><p>\"We should be able to go in and just level the site,\" Rockford said.Because of the high nitrate level in the soil, as recent test results have indicated, it is highly probable that the city will contract with a local farmer to plant a crop at the site once the clean-up and removal of \"black soil\" is completed. Rockford said a crop such as alfalfa will leach many of the nitrates out of the soil. He added that if the clean-up goes according to the timeline set up in the agreement, a 2006 fall planting is possible.In responding to which party would be responsible for any future claims against the property, ecologically speaking, Rockford said federal statute clearly defines that area of the law.\"Whoever causes any such issue is held responsible,\" he said. Rockford said that is not a concern, though, as tests have revealed there is no ground water contamination at the site.The future development of the 150-acre site is unclear at this time. Rockford said no one has shown an interest thus far in purchasing any of that land from the city, which is how Alderwood officials hope to recoup the $2.5 million they are borrowing from invested reserves.", "author": "Bob Story", "type": "News Article", "title": "Monson family will continue operating cattle feed mill", "people": ["Monson"], "locations": ["Alderwood", "Monsons", "Rockford", "Yakima Valley Highway"], "organizations": ["Alderwood", "Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford", "Monsons", "Rockford"], "misc": ["Monsons"]}]}, {"date": "2004-10-09 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "09, Oct 2004", "text": "Russian delegation to visit Brazil and Chile</p><p>Story by: Jamie Smart</p><p>Date Published to Web: 10/9/2004</p><p></p><p>A delegation of the Federation Council of the Russian</p><p>Federation led by Sergey Mironov, Chairman of the Federation Council, is leaving for Brazil and</p><p>Chile on October 31.

BRUNELLIn September, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed legislation that would have raised that state's minimum wage from $6.75 to $7.25 per hour in January and $7.75 in 2006.Meanwhile, Washington's Department of Labor and Industries announced that our state's starting wage will increase to $7.35 starting next year. Washington's minimum wage is already the highest in the country. It is no coincidence that Washington's unemployment rate is also among the highest in the nation.On an hourly basis, Washington's minimum wage will exceed Oregon and Alaska by 25 cents, California by 65 cents and Idaho by $2.20. The truth of the matter is Washington's new minimum wage is closer to $9 an hour and, for some industries, is now over $10 per hour because of employer payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance, Social Security and workers' comp.Unless Washington's Legislature acts in 2005, our minimum wage will automatically go up again in 2006. These automatic increases were part of a union backed initiative that passed in 1998 which mandates annual cost-of-living increases in the minimum wage based on the federal Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.In other words, our state's minimum wage is pegged to wage-rates in Seattle without regard for regional differences in rural parts of the state.Take Dayton, Wa. for example. In Dayton, the world's largest asparagus processing plant will close after next summer's harvest because it cannot compete with cheaper Peruvian asparagus. Part of the reason is Washington's high minimum wage. So, while Washington voters may have had the best of intentions when they passed the automatic wage increases, our high minimum wage has helped kill 50 full-time jobs and 1,000 seasonal jobs in Dayton. That's not what the voters had in mind.California, a state with a heavy dependence on agriculture, would also be hurt by a minimum wage hike. In vetoing the recent legislation, Gov. Schwarzenegger rightfully acknowledged that increasing the state's minimum wage makes it too expensive for employers to hire inexperienced workers or provide jobs for young people and seniors. And remember, small businesses create most of the jobs in this country. In essence, raising the minimum wage ever higher forces farmers and small businesses to cut jobs, replace workers with machines, or simply close up shop.The problem will get worse unless legislators take bold action next year to change the law. They need to do four things to change our state's minimum wage law before it further erodes our state's job base:1) Repeal the automatic cost-of-living increase and raise minimum wage rates only when warranted; 2) Freeze the minimum wage at $7.35 until competing states catch up; 3) Treat the minimum wage the same way we treat prevailing wages in Washington-tie it to local economies; and 4) Establish a lower short-term training wage and a lower minimum wage for anyone under age 18 to encourage employers to offer job opportunities to disadvantaged and young workers.While increasing the minimum wage may have seemed like a good idea, it has ended up hurting the very people it was supposed to help. That's called \"the law of unintended consequences.\" Legislators need to change the law next session.Don C.

In fact, the same census report found that those covered by employer provided coverage dropped to 60 percent of the population, down from 2003 numbers. This hits the minority community the hardest. Latinos and African-Americans account for more than 50 percent of the uninsured population-one out of every three Latinos is uninsured and about one out of every five African-Americans.The tax code has favored employer-provided health insurance for the last 60 years, and in that time, this important benefit has enabled most Americans to get health insurance from their employers.Workers who buy their own health insurance are the only people who don't get a tax break when and if they buy health insurance. This year, employer-provided and self-employed health insurance will enjoy a $155 billion tax break. It is fundamentally unfair that workers are discriminated against by the federal tax code in their purchase of health insurance simply because they buy a policy outside their place of employment.With the jump in the uninsured, surely there should be political momentum behind helping the uninsured get health insurance. But with the campaign season in full swing, the people who desperately need access to affordable health insurance will have to wait until after the next election to get any help at all, unless Congress does something right away.</p><p></p><p>Congress could pass a bill now that would provide relief to workers. This bill, known as \"Fair Care for the Uninsured,\" would provide money for the purchase of health insurance-$1,000 for an individual, $2,000 for a couple, and $3,000 for a family, each year. President Bush has provided funding for this money in his budget.Fair Care would correct the discrimination built into the tax code that currently gives unlimited tax benefits to those who purchase health insurance through their employer, but no tax benefit to the individual purchaser.The money provided under Fair Care would be advanced to workers up front so that they would have money to buy health insurance, and, according to Fiscal Associates, 18.6 million uninsured people could buy health insurance.During this presidential campaign, the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, has suggested other ways to help the uninsured, such as a tax break for small businesses, extending Medicaid to cover low-income children, and enabling workers to buy into health coverage programs for federal employees. However, in 19 years in the Senate, Mr. Kerry has not introduced legislation to address the uninsured crisis.</p><p></p><p>But today he can change that by marching right down to the Senate and adding his name to the Fair Care bill. He doesn't have to wait to make more empty campaign promises. He can make his dream to help the uninsured a reality by immediately supporting this bipartisan legislation.Perhaps it's because Senator Kerry is worth $169 million and gets tax-free health insurance from the federal government. The Florida Times-Union indicated in a recent editorial that Mr. Kerry \"may not see it [the uninsured] as a problem. Admittedly, [Fair Care] would not appeal to those who want to turn health care entirely over to the government, hang the cost.\"</p><p></p><p>Most politicians think reducing the number of uninsured is a good thing.Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress think Fair Care is a good idea and support the legislation. National groups representing Hispanics, small employers and farmers support Fair Care.While some policymakers would like to consign a large number of America's working poor to Medicaid, or some expanded version of Medicaid in which individuals and families will only get the benefits government officials give them, Fair Care is a superior alternative, which would not bust the federal budget and continue to choke state budgets across the country.</p><p></p><p>The best option is to change the tax treatment of health insurance and give low-income working families without health insurance money to help them purchase private health insurance best suited for their families.Robert de Posada is president of The Latino Coalition ( www.thelatinocoalition.com), a non-profit, non-partisan organization based in Washington, D.C.", "author": "", "type": "Auxiliary Article", "title": "Guest Editorial", "people": ["U.

Instead, it was the discussion that took place after the debate that I found most interesting.</p><p></p><p>I have watched or listened to all three of the presidential debates, spending time after each listening to the commentary that takes place from both parties. It's funny, but after each debate both parties work hard to declare their candidate as the winner. I've always thought it was funny that a presidential debate would have a winner to begin with. Maybe I'm a bit naive, but I always thought the presidential debates were meant to inform voters about each of the candidate's policies, and not to see who can \"win\" more of the debates.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, after each debate the candidates' parties spend time simply reiterating what their candidate said. They are also sure to do what they can to make the opponent look bad.</p><p></p><p>But Wednesday night, what really caught my attention was that the post debate conversation wasn't about which side looked better, sounded better or was wearing the best tie. Instead, it was about finding the truth in what each candidate had said.</p><p></p><p>I was listening to National Public Radio (NPR) and I appreciated that the station had taken the time to get ahold of experts, not experts associated with any particular party, but experts who know the policies and history behind each candidate.</p><p></p><p>I sat there and was blown away by some of the things that came to light during the post debate conversation on Wednesday night. I listened with interest as experts pointed out that some of the numbers Sen. John Kerry used during the debate when talking about employment rates were correct, but only if you excluded a large part of the job market - the government, which has seen a growth. I also listened as the experts pointed out that Kerry was incorrect in saying that President George Bush never took time to meet with the Black Congressional Caucus.

The Grizzlies' other early score came in the first quarter when Gilleland popped off a 20-yard touchdown run.The fun for Grizzly fans didn't stop with the end of the first quarter, as Alderwood scored twice in the second period. Gilleland scored both second quarter touchdowns, one off a one-yard run and the other a 22-yard pass from quarterback Tony Cantu.The Wolfpack was able to sustain a drive in the second quarter that led to a touchdown, when Wapato quarterback Jason Pitt found receiver Mark McDaniel on a five-yard pass.The second half was sort of a different story for the Grizzlies, as they didn't look</p><p></p><p>anything like they did in the opening two quarters.The second half saw the Grizzlies fumble three times inside the Wolfpack's 20-yard line.\"We can't afford to cough up the ball,\" said Marro.Wapato took advantage of the slippery hands of the Grizzlies in the second half.The Wolfpack drove nearly the length of the field in the third quarter to see the drive end on a one-yard touchdown run from Art Weaver.With the score 28-14, the Grizzlies got back to pounding the ball on the ground. Gilleland scored on a four-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Teammate Joe Schwartz added a 17-yard touchdown run to account for the final score.Wapato's Justin Clements gave the Wolfpack its last score when he ran past the Grizzly defense on a 74-yard touchdown run.The Grizzlies did a nice job of keeping Wapato's defense guessing.</p><p></p><p>Alderwood was able to mix in an effective passing game with a dominating run attack. Cantu went 10-for-16 on the night through the air for 186 yards.\"We wanted Tony to throw the ball,\" said Marro. \"We are going to need him to throw the ball in the next couple of weeks.\"Marro said he was impressed with the way Wapato played, as the Wolfpack was putting some hard hits on the Grizzlies.\"They have steadily gotten better,\" said Marro.Marro was also impressed with the play of his offensive line, which opened holes for Gilleland and Schwartz all night.Gilleland ended up rushing for 158 yards on 24 carries while Schwartz had 101 yards off 14 totes.</p><p></p><p>Gilleland also had two receptions for 67 yards. Gilleland set a new school record for most points scored in a game. Gilleland scored 30 points on Friday night, breaking Larry Coleman's record set in 1979 of 26 points against East Valley-Spokane. Gilleland also tied the record with a host of other players for most rushing touchdowns in a game with three.One Alderwood player who performed extremely well Friday night was Noe Zamarron, who was both a force on the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. Zamarron had three catches for 52 yards.\"He has great hands,\" said Marro. \"Noe is an exceptional athlete.\"The only drawback in the game that Marro saw was the fumbles by Alderwood in the second half. Marro also felt his defensive unit could have done a better job of tackling in the second half.\"We missed a lot of tackles,\" said Marro.Besides the fumbles, Marro felt his team did an exceptional job of playing the game.\"We got pretty much what we expected from the players,\" said Marro.Alderwood (2-2, 4-3) will be without the services of Gilleland for a crucial Mid-Valley League match-up at Ellensburg. Gilleland was ejected late from Friday's game for an altercation with a Wapato player.\"It is always a tough place to play at Ellensburg,\" said Marro. \"I am excited about the game.\"Marro said the game against Ellensburg is a must win if Alderwood wants to stay in playoff contention.</p><p>", "author": "John Panni", "type": "News Article", "title": "Grizzlies maul the Wolves in Homecoming game", "people": ["Wapato", "Greg Gilleland", "Joe Schwartz", "Mark Marro", "Gilleland", "Tony Cantu", "Jason Pitt", "Mark Mc Daniel", "Marro", "Art Weaver", "Justin Clements", "Cantu", "Tony", "Schwartz", "Larry Coleman", "Noe Zamarron", "Zamarron", "Noe"], "locations": ["Grizzly", "Ellensburg"], "organizations": ["Alderwood High School", "Grizzlies", "Alderwood", "Wolfpack", "East Valley- Spokane", "Ellensburg"], "misc": ["Mid- Valley League"]}, {"date": "18, Oct 2004", "text": "Mabton grid team tethers Billy Goats</p><p>Story by: Bob Story</p><p>Date Published to Web: 10/18/2004</p><p></p><p>PATEROS - The Pateros Billy Goats were undefeated in Central Washington 'B' League play heading into last Friday's football game against visiting Mabton. They no longer are.Mabton bullied the Billy Goats enroute to scoring a 35-17 conference victory.\"It was big,\" said Mabton Coach D.J. Search. \"We out-physicaled them.\"The coaches and kids did a good of watching film last week. We were all confident we were going to be more physical than them,\" Search said.Search credits his offensive and defensive lines for taking control of the game. \"Both lines played outstanding,\" he said.Defensively, Mabton limited Pateros to just 86 rushing yards. The Billy Goats did gain about 150 yards through the air, although the Pateros QB, Zahn, was picked once. The interception was claimed by Mabton free safety Ryan Harris.Search explained that Pateros employed a spread offense against his club, often times using pro sets in the backfield.\"We just played assignment defense against them,\" he said. \"We stayed in our 5-3 defense, except on 3rd and long plays when we jumped into something else.\"We were very physical against them,\" Search added. \"Our whole defense did their job. They came to play. Tackling was very good.\"Offensively, the Vikings' line was just as physical, which resulted in some large holes being opened for Mabton's running backs. The Vikes' leading ground gainers were Pablo Sanchez, Alex Zavala and Ray Elizondo. Sanchez tallied 108 yards on the ground on 13 carries. Zavala scooted for 93 yards on 10 totes, and Elizondo ran the ball 11 times for 61 yards.Mabton QB Ryan Harris didn't have to air it out much Friday night. He only attempted nine passes, completing three of them for 80 yards. Zavala had two of the receptions, accouting for 72 of the 80 passing yards.The Vikes opened a 14-0 lead on Pateros with two first quarter scores. Sanchez had the first TD, that coming on a 61-yard breakaway run. Harris had a 2-yard dive for the second touchdown.Pateros countered with a 39-yard TD pass late in the opening quarter to cut Mabton's lead to 14-6.The Vikes responded in the second quarter, though, punching in two more touchdowns to build their lead to 28-6. Jovanni Ochoa, on his only carry of the game because Sanchez's helmet was broken, scored the first of the two TD's on a 3-yard plunge. The other touchdown came on Sanchez's second score of the night, a 9-yard scamper.Pateros closed the gap to 28-10 just before the half on a 28-yard field goal.Mabton added an insurance score in the third quarter when Zavala broke loose and raced 16 yards for a TD. Marco Zepeda followed up the touchdown with his fifth consecutive successful PAT kick of the night.The Billy Goats got a second TD pass from Zahn in the final quarter to account for the final 35-17 score.Last Friday's win improved Mabton's South Central 'B' League record to 4-2, 5-2 overall. The Vikings are scheduled to play a non-league game at Highland (3-4) this coming Friday.Pateros slipped to 4-1 in conference play with the loss, and the Billy Goats still have to play league leading Waterville (5-0).", "author": "Bob Story", "type": "News Article", "title": "Mabton grid team tethers Billy Goats", "people": ["Billy Goats", "Zahn", "Ryan Harris", "Pateros", "Pablo Sanchez", "Alex Zavala", "Ray Elizondo", "Sanchez", "Zavala", "Elizondo", "Harris", "Jovanni Ochoa", "D.

Jim Honeyford and Representatives Bruce Chandler and Dan Newhouse also talked about concerns they have with the WASL, school funding, charter schools and the future of education in the state.</p><p></p><p>Ian Grabenhorst, assistant superintendent for ESD 105, listed some concerns the educational district holds. Amongst the educational priorities Grabenhorst outlined were a focus on amply funding K-12 education. He suggested the state complete a comprehensive review of the finance system and establish a sustainable, predictable and fair state funded system for public schools.Making a constitutional amendment that would allow school districts to pass a levy with a simple majority is also key to better education in Washington, said Grabenhorst.He asked the state legislators to consider repealing unfunded mandates, which are difficult to implement without funding in place.\"We have requests that are set in front of our districts and no funding,\" said Grabenhorst.</p><p></p><p>He also asked the legislators to oppose binding arbitration and to reinforce the state's \"no strike\" laws.Sen. Honeyford, in his opening comments, said one of the major issues facing the legislature this budget cycle is money.\"We'll have at least a $1 billion deficit, plus collective bargaining. We'll probably be a billion-two upside down to start with,\" he said.He explained that K-12 education receives about 43 percent of the state's budget and another 10 percent goes to higher education. Corrections receives about 30 percent, leaving the state with about 20 percent of the money as discretionary.Honeyford said they have had difficulties getting the votes to make strikes illegal, but they are still working on it.He said he believes that questions about the WASL will once again return to the state level this next year.\"The WASL to some people is the holy grail to end education problems,\" said Honeyford. \"I don't like it. It's terribly expensive for what we get.\"Another concern is non-English speakers and the disabled taking the test.</p><p></p><p>Chandler takes a different view on the test. He believes there has to be some kind of benchmark or test to see the educational growth.\"I believe at the end of the day most students will achieve our expectations of them,\" he said. \"If we expect great things they will rise to that.\"He added that he believes there is a lot to be said for better than average students.Chandler said a K-12 task force has been looking at education in the state and one of the areas it found of interest is special education funding.\"In areas some districts are making money on it and others are in the hole,\" said Chandler.Chandler said if Initiative 884 going before voters to help fund public education is passed it will be the highest tax increase in the history of the state. He said that if the initiative fails that most likely the legislators will be reluctant to increase taxes.\"If it passes it will probably be the only tax increase passed mainly because of its size,\" said Chandler.A concern Chandler has with the initiative is that if the 1 percent increase in retail sales tax for K-12 education is put in a fund and decided upon by a citizen oversight committee, he foresees the legislature having very little input on public education.</p><p></p><p>One of Newhouse's main concerns is the class of 2008 being required to pass the WASL to graduate.\"There's concern about the dropout rate if we don't do anything about it,\" said Newhouse.But, some changes may be afoot at the state level.Currently, there are 25 Republicans in the Senate and 24 Democrats. With four close races, Honeyford feels it's too close to call what it will be like next year.The House of Representatives has 52 Democrats and 46 Republicans.\"That six-vote difference was determined in the last election by 1,700 people,\" said Chandler. \"This year we expect voter turnout to exceed 70 percent. Ten percent of voters in Yakima County could be new voters, which creates a lot of uncertainty.\"Local pastor and a member of the Alderwood School District's ethics committee, Ron Jetter, addressed the trend to combat obesity at the school level by banning certain foods and beverages from school grounds. He asked if the legislators anticipate a state law that would ban certain foods.Chandler said that last year two bills in the House addressed child obesity. One of the bills would have banned certain foods from being sold on school grounds. The other, known as the \"Fat Tax,\" would have taxed foods based on ingredients. The problem, he said, is that some candy bars would be taxed and others wouldn't.Chandler anticipates at least one proposal this year, but he would much rather leave it at the school board level.In all, the legislators are looking forward to an interesting session.</p><p></p><p>They said they appreciated the input from those who are on the front line of education, which helps them in their decision making process in Olympia.The light at the end of the tunnel, Honeyford added at the end, is that the economic downfall the state has been experiencing is expected to end in 2009. He anticipates programs that have been neglected with funding, such as education, will receive more funding..

BRUNELLLouisiana has 16 chronically failing public schools, 15 of which are in the city of New Orleans. After years of infighting and finger pointing, the state has finally taken a bold step to solve the problem. The state of Louisiana took over a public school. If we don't stick to our 1992 school reforms here in Washington, the same thing could happen here.</p><p></p><p>The P.A. Capdau Middle School had floundered for years. Last spring, more than half of its eighth-graders failed the LEAP test, Louisiana's version of Washington's WASL. The school's seventh-graders fared even worse, scoring lower than 81 percent of their peers nationwide on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The school has had eight principals in the last 10 years and changed its education programs three times in the past three years.</p><p></p><p>In April, following years of warnings and second chances, the state took over the school and turned it over to the University of New Orleans. The University has had a plan in place since 2001 to create a charter school district of as many as ten troubled schools, but opposition from the School Board and the teachers union stopped the plan dead in its tracks. But with Capdau, the University finally got its chance to try a different approach.The changes came swiftly. Using a $250,000 donation from a local bank, the University gave the neglected school a fresh coat of paint, repaired leaky ceilings and installed new lights to brighten its dark and dingy hallways. Next, the University hired a veteran local principal with a get-tough reputation, replaced all but one of Capdau's teachers, and implemented a new curriculum that tailors instruction to each student. The idea is to help students learn at their own pace, rather than promote them to the next grade whether or not they'd learned the material. As with Washington state's education reforms, Louisiana wants to make sure its high school diplomas are more than just a record of attendance.</p><p></p><p>With the curriculum in place, the search for students and teachers began. More than 500 students applied for the 264 spaces available at the school. Students were selected by lottery from applicants who lived within a five-mile radius of the school. The grandmother of two students selected for Capdau told state and school officials that the school takeover was the answer to her prayers.Teachers were not as impressed. Applications to work at Capdau came in slowly. Soured by years of failed school reform efforts, teachers were wary of signing on to yet another experiment in education reform. Eventually, University officials overcame their concerns, and more than 60 teachers applied for 16 available teaching positions.At a training session two weeks before the start of school, teachers were warned to discard their old ideas.</p><p></p><p>\"Perception is reality,\" the trainer warned, and if they expected their students to be unruly and incapable, the students would respond to those expectations. \"I want you to grab those perceptions,\" said the trainer, \"and toss them on the floor.\"Of course, the teachers aren't nave; they understand the difficulty of their challenge. But they are optimistic that they and the University will be able to change the lives of hundreds of students for the better.The school year at the new Capdau Charter School has just begun. This year, they're focusing on K-3 and the 7th and 8th grades, but eventually, Capdau will be a K-8 school. Parents, teachers and elected officials throughout Louisiana and the nation are watching closely. A success at Capdau could serve as a model for thousands of failing schools across the country.</p><p></p><p>In New Orleans, a single charter school has brought hope and optimism to hundreds of parents. On Nov. 2, Washington voters will decide whether to keep our state's charter schools alternative. By approving Referendum 55, we can ensure that parents and children in our state have an alternative to failing schools.", "author": "", "type": "Auxiliary Article", "title": "Guest Editorial", "people": ["Capdau"], "locations": ["Louisiana", "New Orleans", "Washington", "Capdau"], "organizations": ["P.

The lodge was sold several years back and reopened as the Fairway Restaurant. The restaurant was closed earlier this year. The monstrous building is now in the hands of the Rice's, who are the general partners and majority owners of RS Kids LLC, made up of a small group of investors intent on offering adult entertainment in the Lower Valley.</p><p></p><p>The Alderwood couple is quick to point out that its new venture, to be called RC's, is much more than just a casino. A restaurant offering formal dining, as well as a sports bar and banquet rooms, will hopefully draw a wide array of people into the new establishment, they say.</p><p></p><p>The restaurant and sports bar are tentatively scheduled to be opened on Nov. 16. The Rice's are planning for a Dec. 1 opening of their casino.</p><p></p><p>The site being developed for the new business, along Alderwood Valley Highway between Alderwood and Grandview, lies in an unincorporated area of the county. As such, all gaming taxes generated at RC's will go into Alderwood County coffers. There is a potential for the county to net a quarter of a million dollars annually from the gambling taxes.</p><p></p><p>A more realistic figure, says Mr. Rice, (perhaps conservative depending on who you talk to), is that $180,000 will be generated in gaming taxes each year. Rice bases his estimate on how similar sized mini-casinos have fared in other communities in Washington state.</p><p></p><p>Alderwood County commissioners earlier this year, at the request of the Rice's, lowered the gaming tax rate from 20 percent to 10 percent-the same rate the City of Yakima assesses card room and mini-casino owners doing business in that municipality. RC's will be the first casino from which the county will draw taxes.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, the approximate $200,000 expected to be netted in gaming taxes each year at RC's could have gone into the City of Alderwood's bank account. In June 2002, the Rice's sought permission from the city to expand their bowling center, to include a mini-casino. Their business, Valley Lanes, is located in the heart of the city, directly across from the high school on Edison Avenue.</p><p></p><p>But when the couple began making inquiries at city hall in late May 2002, the Alderwood City Council quickly enacted an emergency moratorium on accepting license applications for house-banked card rooms. Later that year, in November, despite the Alderwood Planning Commisson's recommendation to allow mini-casinos in the city, the Council vote unanimously to prohibit any such gambling activities within the city limits.</p><p></p><p>\"Our first choice was to do business in our own town,\" said Rice, a native of Alderwood who has operated several businesses in the city, including the bowling center he now operates and several mini-marts.</p><p></p><p>\"Being forced out of the city to do business, we've had to spend more money than we wanted to,\" he continued. \"The plan had been to offer an all-in-one package at the bowl, although the casino would have been separate from the bowling end of it.\"</p><p></p><p>What has Alderwood lost?</p><p></p><p>\"Obviously, the $180,000 in taxes each year,\" said Rice. \"Who couldn't use that kind of money?</p><p></p><p>\"Our original plan was to have an all-inclusive entertainment center at the bowl. It was something we wanted in Alderwood, something that could appeal to families.</p><p></p><p>\"The fear might have been that a card room would bring in trouble,\" he continued. \"But card playing doesn't bring in the trouble. It's the alcohol that can cause problems.</p><p></p><p>\"But we were already serving alcohol at the bowl. We didn't have trouble with that, and we still don't.</p><p></p><p>\"There's not a lot of entertainment options in Alderwood. We wanted to add something to the community,\" said Rice, a professional bowler who still takes time to compete at several PBA events each year despite his hectic business schedule.</p><p></p><p>The Rice's have not had to deal with the City of Alderwood on their current endeavor. Their new casino doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the local municipality. The processing of the paperwork and permits has been through the Washington State Gambling Commission and with the county. Final approval from the state is expected within weeks, if not days.</p><p></p><p>Although the City of Alderwood won't directly benefit from taxes generated at RC's, there will be an economical benefit via the creation of between 50 and 70 new jobs at the casino and restaurant. The Rice's are currently advertising the job openings, which include everything from managers and floor supervisors, waitresses, dealers, security and surveillance personnel to cooks, cashiers and dish washers.

The BSE problem came to North America first hitting the United States in December 2001 when a cow in nearby Alderwood was diagnosed with the disease.BSE is a neurological disease in cattle. The disease is mainly passed in cattle by feed. However, the disease can also be passed genetically, said Meyer. Until bans were put into place on the type of feed that could be used, cattle were fed meat and bone meal to help provide the animals with needed protein and calcium.Meyer said the USDA and other agencies spent six to seven weeks investigating the first BSE case to ever hit the United States. Meyer said that the BSE cow in Alderwood, which was exported from Canada, and the cow with BSE found in Alberta, Canada, at one time were kept within 50 to 100 miles of each other.</p><p></p><p>Meyer, though, said the risk is extremely low for BSE to become a problem in the U.S. like it was in England. He cited a 2001 study done by Harvard University that said with all the safety measures the United States has in place to prevent BSE, the risk for the disease to spread like it did in England is extremely low.\"Even if we were to get it, with all the bans we have in place it should phase out,\" said Meyer.But to help ensure consumer confidence and to find out where the BSE situation stands in the United States, USDA has begun a BSE testing program, said Meyer. The program will be overseen by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) division within USDA. Meyer said the testing program will be across the country, lasting between 12 and 18 months.The program began this past June, Meyer said, and will be a one-time effort by USDA. The program is meant to see if BSE is present in the cattle industry and if so at what levels.Under the program, USDA will assist cattle farmers with any cost of participating in the program. USDA officials will only be testing cattle in the high-risk population, meaning non-ambulatory cattle, cattle exhibiting signs of a central nervous disorder, cattle exhibiting signs associated with BSE and dead cattle.</p><p></p><p>\"If we are going to find them (cattle with BSE), we are going to find them in that high-risk category,\" said Meyer.Meyer said the program will be targeting cattle older than 30 months. Meyer said the target age is older because cattle can carry the BSE disease up to 90 months.USDA will be working with officials at slaughter houses, farms and livestock auctions to find cattle in the high-risk population, as well as cattle farmers.Meyer said there is also a tracking system for cattle that makes it easy to trace back where the animals came from.Testing of animals will be done using ELISA, which is a rapid screening test that gives officials quick results. USDA is working with various laboratories across the country, including in Washington state, to provide test results. Meyers said any inconclusive results will be double-checked at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa.", "author": "John Panni", "type": "News Article", "title": "Plan in place to monitor spread of BSE in United States", "people": ["Rory Meyer", "Meyer", "A.

She explained that the Yakima Valley chambers are working together to organize a 10-day festival that will attract those who are visiting the area for Spring Barrel tasting to stay and enjoy what the Valley has to offer.Corliss said since the inception of Spring Barrel tasting, the event has grown to such a magnitude that area wineries are beginning to expand, what was once a one weekend event, into a two weekend affair.</p><p></p><p>She said wineries found that as Spring Barrel tasting grew they weren't able to spend the one-on-one time with their customers. Now, wineries are beginning to invite their VIP customers to attend a pre-barrel tasting event the weekend before.And it's that expansion of Spring Barrel tasting that the local chambers are trying to build on.Corliss explained that local businessman Tom Denlea, who recently opened the Best Western Grapevine Inn in Alderwood, brought the idea of a Valley-wide festival to the forefront after observing the Tulip Festival that takes place every year in the Skagit Valley. Corliss said Denlea noted that the communities in that area worked together to fill the 13 days of the Tulip Festival with a variety of activities.\"So when people are in town for the Tulip Festival, they have something to do that isn't necessary tulip [related],\" Corliss said. She added that as a result of the combined efforts the festival brings $16 million in tourism revenue into the Skagit Valley.She said the Spring Fling festival can serve as a way for the communities in the Yakima Valley to take advantage of the many visitors who come into the area for Spring Barrel tasting. Corliss admitted that when planning for the festival first started, the different communities involved were a little territorial. However, as time has gone by the communities have realized that working together is what is important when it comes to making the festival a success.\"It has been a great process,\" Corliss said.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Corliss said the group of chambers involved in coordinating the Spring Fling festival are working on preparing the calendar of events. She encouraged any organization interested in putting together an event to come forward.\"We're excited about it,\" she said, noting that the event is already starting to see growth.Other business that took place during the Granger Chamber of Commerce meeting yesterday included the presentation of a check to the Granger Aquatics Committee. Chamber President Mary Kresse presented a check for $500 to the committee, challenging 10 other people to donate $100 each, which two members did. To date, the Granger Aquatics Committee has raised $5,860 toward a new pool facility for the community.To help raise additional funds, the committee is hosting a yard sale at the Lions Club building at 109 E. A St. in Granger, Saturday, Oct. 23, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Donations for the yard sale are being accepted at the site from noon to 5 p.m. today (Friday).", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "Spring Fling evolving into a 10-day festival", "people": ["Kathy Corliss", "Corliss", "Wapato", "Tom Denlea", "Denlea", "Mary Kresse", "Granger"], "locations": ["Benton City", "Yakima Valley", "Valley", "Spring Barrel", "Alderwood", "Tulip Festival", "Skagit Valley", "Spring Fling"], "organizations": ["Alderwood Chamber of Commerce Director of Promotions", "Granger Chamber of Commerce", "Spring Barrel", "Best Western Grapevine Inn", "Granger Aquatics Committee", "Lions Club", "St."], "misc": ["Valley-wide"]}, {"date": "22, Oct 2004", "text": "Lady 'Hounds getting close to another perfect season</p><p>Story by: Ellie Olmsen</p><p>Date Published to Web: 10/22/2004</p><p></p><p></p><p>MOXEE - The Lady Greyhounds are on their way to their third consecutive undefeated season.

The judges nominated by President Bush is one of the issues that hasn't been voted on.\"Approve or disapprove, but at least vote on it,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"George has a great voting record. He's got a great record on the issues,\" she said.Unfortunately, she added, a lot of bills come out of the House and are \"...buried in the graveyard of the Senate.\"Besides stem cell research, Nethercutt said her husband is in favor of drilling in the Arctic. She said that when super-imposed over the continental United States, Alaska covers about 1/3rd of the country. She explained that when they talk about drilling they are only talking about touching 2,000 acres of 19 million acres of pristine wilderness.\"Until we have energy independence we are going to be held hostage at the fuel pumps,\" said Nethercutt.The South Carolina native added that her husband supported the dams in Washington state when there was a push to remove them.George Nethercutt has also been instrumental in working with the Bush administration to develop a research facility at Washington State University that would be able to test for Mad Cow Disease, she said.\"The next closest facility is in Iowa,\" said Mrs. Nethercutt.She added that her husband is also in favor of capping the amount that can be paid out for pain and suffering in lawsuits against doctors in the state. She said that Washington is losing talented physicians and it is not only the rural communities that are feeling the brunt of the shortage. At a rally in Spokane last week, she said a woman who is due to have a baby in February spoke about her needs of a obstetrician.

Why?</p><p>Because it puts educational standards into place for all students. This is especially important for low income and minority students, too many of whom have fallen through the cracks in our public education system over the years. Results are already showing up in our local school districts, as well as in other districts that have struggled across the country.</p><p>As with so many other issues, President Bush is a noteworthy exception to the average politician. When he encounters a problem, his response is not to complain or blame someone else for the problem. His response is to try to solve the problem.</p><p>We don't often have a president with the vision to lead in this fashion. But we can certainly keep this one for four more years.

Privatization was generally initiated by new management, often not long term residents of the locale, interested in trimming the budget. The tactic was to persuade the general public that eliminating such expensive items as decent living wages, cost of living allowances and health benefit packages would lower the cost of city and county services and provide a financial boost for the local economy.</p><p>However, a major consideration was ignored: when a public works crew, like the one in Alderwood, dedicates a consistent work effort, shows concern for the needs of the public, and invests time and money in the community voluntarily, as residents, outside of the work schedule.</p><p>The result is that not only do the new \"privatized\" employees fail to respond in a timely fashion to citizens' needs, but they are not invested in the community. So the quality of performance is heavily diminished.</p><p>I would hope that the people of Alderwood are willing to carefully scrutinize the proposal to privatize the public works department. It would be, in my opinion, a major error in judgment.</p><p>/s/ Sonja McDaniel, Alderwood</p><p></p><p>The Little Council of Sside (Related to The Little Red Hen)</p><p>One day as the little Council of Alderwood was struggling, having issues with clean air, clean water and quality of life;</p><p>\"This should be resolved,\" they said. \"Who will help us with this problem?\" \"Not I,\" said Yakima County. \"Not I,\" said Yakima Clean Air Authority. \"Not I,\" said New Vision.</p><p>\"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood.

I didn't get a new car, but did get confused and somewhat shocked with the whole \"trading in your car\" business. I understand that a dealership needs to make money in order to have a viable business, but how much is too much? And at whose expense?</p><p>Like many of your readers, I know the difference between the retail values and and the trade-in values. But it wasn't until my last negotiating attempts that I really grasped what it meant.</p><p>Let's assume that a trade-in value for a car is $2,500 less than the retail value. Automobile dealerships will not typically pay more than the trade-in value of a car, which means they automatically make a $2,500 profit.</p><p>Furthermore, the cars at dealerships are typically overpriced by an average of $4,000 (from what I have been told by friends in the car business). This means that if you trade in your car at the trade-in value rate and buy a car at the retail value, the dealership would make $6,500 in one deal. Imagine that!</p><p>Now...imagine this happening to about 50 deals a month. That totals $325,000 in profits in one month.</p><p>Automobile dealerships are out to take advantage of consumers. It's not like if consumers can just say to heck with it. The reality is, consumers need transportation to survive. The price that dealerships blindly force consumers to pay, however, is an outrage.</p><p>Consumers, including myself, need to be thoroughly educated on the type of deals they are getting into.

BRUNELLSelling change is always difficult, but when it involves public schools and our kids' education, it is daunting at best. Dr. Rod Paige is President Bush's Secretary of Education and the chief architect of \"No Child Left Behind.\" Surprisingly, he is the first superintendent of schools to hold that post.Paige's father was a public school principal, his mother a public school librarian. Born in 1933 in segregated Monticello, Mississippi, Paige earned a Bachelor's degree from Jackson State University and a Master's and Doctoral degree from Indiana University. Prior to joining the Bush Cabinet, he was superintendent of schools in Houston.Dr. Paige has a disarming style. For example, while in Seattle recently, he conducted a town hall meeting where teachers and activists confronted him over their frustrations with Washington's school reforms, the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL), and \"No Child Left Behind.\"</p><p></p><p>He listened carefully and thoughtfully responded. Most importantly, while he may have disagreed with the speaker, he respected their right to disagree.At the end of the evening, some of his antagonists continued to disagree with him and the school reforms he supports, but he commanded the respect due to a top federal education official. Dr. Paige told the audience that tests are necessary to evaluate a student's progress. For example, without a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, there is no way to know if a person has high blood pressure and to monitor it to ensure that treatment is working. The same goes for education-you need tools and measurements to make informed decisions.Paige also believes test scores are a measure of where students have problems, and he rejects the notion of averaging school and district test scores as an indicator of progress.\"No Child Left Behind\" is not about averaging the scores of high performers and low achievers.</p><p></p><p>It is about ensuring that kids don't fall through the cracks, passed from grade to grade unable to master the skills they'll need to succeed in the real world.For example, studies show that if a student cannot read proficiently after the third grade, their problems in school only compound. He encourages parents to read to their children and have their children read to them. \"No Child Left Behind\" also sets aside federal funds for tutoring students from low income and disadvantaged families.Dr. Paige reminded his audience that President Bush has increased education funding by nearly 60 percent since the Clinton Administration left office. He also was quick to point out that funding for K-12 is the state's responsibility and the federal government supplements, not supplants, that support.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Paige unabashedly supports school choice and charter schools-highly unpopular with the teachers' union. He believes all students and parents should have choices, not just the families who can afford to send their children to private schools.Being on the front line, battling for change is a tough job even with less volatile issues, but Dr. Paige has handled his job well. Americans should be grateful there are dedicated educators like Paige because their persistence will keep our country competitive and full of opportunity.Like Gov. Locke, Education Secretary Rod Paige is convinced that education breaks down racial, cultural and poverty barriers.

He specifically referred to how well Mr. Kerry looked and acted in the third presidential debate. The writer seemed to be most impacted by the image Sen. Kerry portrayed.</p><p>In this media saturated culture it seems that image is \"everything.\" Granted, looks are important but when it comes to picking a president for our nation we need to look beyond the pretty package.</p><p>If we look back at two examples of previous presidents, we can point to glaringly stark contrasts. Remember Ronald Regan. What a gentleman. A man with rock-solid principles, a fantastic marriage and a man whose word was as good as his handshake. Even his enemies, such as Gorbachev, came to respect him.</p><p>Contrast Reagan with Bill Clinton. Even before he won the presidency, a parade of \"bimbos\" gave witness to Clinton's marital indiscretions. Foreign leaders mocked him behind his back. As Commander in Chief, Clinton gutted the military. For example, he reduced active Air Force personnel from 650,000 to 240,000 people during his two terms. Many of the best officers voluntarily took early retirement rather than serve under a man they could not respect. And then to top it all, he lied in court and to the American people. His own state took away his license to practice law.</p><p>So what does this have to do with the 2004 election?</p><p>President Bush is a man of his word. He has principles and integrity. He stands for what he believes. Our military loves him as Commander in Chief. And he has a fantastic marriage.</p><p>Then there's Sen. Kerry. Fresh from his four-month tour (others served one year) in Vietnam, he went before a Congressional hearing and confessed to war crimes while still a commissioned officer. Then he accused those he served with of crimes against civilians without one shred of evidence. He has voted against bills supporting new weapons and funding for the military. Yet, he claims that he has all the qualities to instill loyalty by our soldiers who daily lay their lives on the line to defend us from those who want to kill us and take our freedom. Give me a break!</p><p>Finally, I want to remind my neighbors how ancient Israel's leader, David, was chosen. After all of Jessee's handsome sons had been paraded before Samuel, one little shepherd boy became one of the greatest kings in all history. When Samuel asked God why He chose David, God told Samuel that \"Men look on the outside (image) of a man, but the Lord looks on the heart (character) of a man.\"</p><p>/s/ Rick Herndon, Alderwood</p><p></p><p>Defending Kerry an attack on Vietnam veterans</p><p>I was watching TV the other night when a representative from the Veterans Administration was asked whether Sen. John Kerry was telling the truth in 1971, or whether the \"Swift Vets for Truth\" were. This man said that John Kerry was telling the truth.</p><p>I was shocked. My understanding is that even Kerry has said that he had no firm knowledge of atrocities to back up what he said back in 1971. He admits that he stretched the truth. So why would one of our representatives say that Kerry told the truth.</p><p>I was in college in 1971 and I remember how hard it hit me when Kerry told those lies. I also remember that Congress was so upset by what Kerry had told them that they called in Telford Taylor from Columbia Law University in New York to investigate the atrocities being committed in Vietnam. You might recall that Taylor was the chief prosecutor during the War Crimes Trials in Nuremberg, Germany at the end of WWII.</p><p>After Taylor's investigation he said that he found very few cases of true atrocities taking place in Vietnam. He did say that many times our soldiers had killed civilians, but in almost every case he investigated he found that it was not an atrocity at all. He said that these incidents were very sad and hard for soldiers to deal with, but they were not a crime according to the Geneva Convention. The civilians were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the aim was not to kill the civilians just for the joy of it. In fact, most soldiers felt guilty for having killed innocent people during firefights. It was not their intent.</p><p>In the end Taylor said the Rules of Engagement were impeccable. He said the Rules of Engagement were so impeccable that he found it difficult to believe that soldiers would follow them, as it would cost them their lives to do so. Taylor said that the way in which we fought the war caused many soldiers to lose their lives, in order that civilians would be spared theirs. And he said that he felt that was unacceptable during war. In the end he said the Vietnam War was the cleanest war that America had ever fought; that it had the fewest atrocities by any measure compared to other wars; and that he found a renewed sense of awe for those who were fighting the war, even though he was firmly against it.</p><p>To my knowledge no one has disputed Taylor's assessment of the war with regards to war crimes having been committed by our troops, so why would one of our representatives say that Kerry was \"right\" back in 1971, referring to our fellow soldiers as war criminals?</p><p>I think John Kerry threw gasoline on the fire back in 1971. He convinced people that Jane Fonda was right. And that caused the war protesters to harass the returning soldiers on college campuses at a higher level than what they had been doing before. I know, I was there. After Kerry spoke to Congress in 1971 it was very ugly for the veterans who were attending college and trying to further their education.</p><p>In 1971 I remember watching (from afar) an anti-war rally on campus one day, and watched as the students cheered when it was announced how many returing Vietnam veterans had committed suicide after coming home. They truly wanted to see us dead. Their level of cruelty was more brutal than any acts by infantry soldiers that I had ever seen.</p><p>The question remains: why doesn't John Kerry go on TV and debate these Swift Boat Veterans, and the POWs and the recipients of the Medal of Honor that have spoken out against him on TV ads? He could end this whole debate once and for all. He's a very good debater. He had the courage to debate George Bush, so why not do all Vietnam veterans a great favor and debate these men as well? They have proven to be honorable men, thus I would like him to step up to the plate and discuss this whole matter on national TV.</p><p>That doesn't sound like much to me, especially if Kerry thinks he's right.</p><p>I wish he would either defend himself against these veterans, or apologize for what he did. My view is that he needs to apologize for the lies he told, and the damage that those lies did to Vietnam veterans. And he especially needs to apologize to family members of those returning Vietnam veterans who committed suicide when they were unable to stand up to the attacks committed on them by their peers. It must be remembered that these veterans returned home physically fatigued, mentally fatigued and spiritually fatigued. They required nurturing, not the attacks hurled at them.</p><p>But still today people come to the defense of John Kerry and encourage others to continue to attack our veterans. For any defense of John Kerry is an attack on those who honorably served in Vietnam, and who say that they are proud of their service in Vietnam, and who also say that they would serve again if asked.</p><p>/s/ Greg Schlieve, Vietnam veteran, Grandview</p><p>", "author": "", "type": "Auxiliary Article", "title": "Forum", "people": ["John Torch", "Rob Rice", "Patty S.

His duties as a classroom assistant means he helps the head teacher prepare for each school day.EPIC provides pre-school services to children ages 3-1/2 to 5 years old. Bueno said EPIC tries to fill the program with older children first and then if it can't it turns to the younger applicants.Bueno must really enjoy his job because he has been doing it for 14 years.</p><p></p><p>\"I first started as a volunteer,\" he said. \"Then I applied for an open position.\"What keeps Bueno at his job?\"I enjoy the interaction I have with the children and the families,\" said Bueno. \"That is what has kept me there.\"Besides the children, Bueno said the best part of going to work is being around his co-workers.\"It is kind of like my home away from home,\" said Bueno. \"The environment is very friendly.\"Just how many children has Bueno dealt with over the last 14 years? Bueno took some time to count some of his past pupils and came up with 564 children he has helped prepare for the public school system.Bueno said his favorite part of seeing former students is being able to look at the progress each child has made.\"Looking at them makes me feel old,\" laughed Bueno.When he is not at work, Bueno is busy taking care of his family. Bueno and his wife, Betty, have three children, Devina, 6, Emilio, 3, and Jonathan, 1, with another child on the way.In his spare time, Bueno, a 1990 graduate of Alderwood High School, enjoys reading books and collecting toys.</p><p></p><p>\"I also try to spend as much time as I can with my kids,\" smiled Bueno.Right now, Bueno is splitting time between his family, work and attending Yakima Valley Community College, where he is scheduled to earn his Associate's degree at the end of winter quarter.

It is also a day when voters get a chance to voice their opinion on the fate of various ballot measures.This year the ballot measures gave voters a chance to decide on the fate of everything from the presence of electronic scratch tickets at licensed non-tribal gaming establishments to the creation of an education trust fund in the state.Tuesday, voters came out in force and let their feelings be known.</p><p></p><p>Initiative 872When it comes to the creation of a new primary election format, Washington voters overwhelming voted for change. In Yakima County, 67.8 percent of voters approved the initiative. This mirrors the response from voters across Washington state, where 59.9 percent voted for the initiative.The initiative gives voters a chance to vote for all candidates in a primary election with the top two candidates moving on to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.Those opposed to the initiative were concerned that the two-top primary could result in a single party election in some races come November.According to the State of Washington Voters' pamphlet, the passage of I-872 could mean lowering the annual cost of the primary election system by as much as $6 million from the system currently in place.Initiative 884Initiative 884 asked voters to approve the creation of an education trust fund by increasing the sales tax across the state by 1 percent.This was a measure voted down by voters yesterday. In Yakima County, 60.59 percent of voters voted against I-884. These numbers nearly mirror the results statewide, where 60.74 percent of voters decided against the initiative.Those against the initiative pointed to the fact that Washington is already the seventh highest taxed state in the nation and already has one of the highest sales tax rates.Those for the initiative felt it would help provide additional funding for the state's education system.If the measure had passed it would have increased the state sales tax, which currently sits at 7.5 percent, by 1 percent. This new revenue would have been put aside to help support education throughout the state. According to the Washington State Voters' pamphlet, it would have provided additional funds for K-12 schools, as well as pre-school assistance for low income children and post-secondary education.Initiative 892Tuesday, voters flexed their muscles and voted down Initiative 892, which dealt with electronic scratch ticket machines.The initiative would have made it possible for authorized, licensed non-tribal gambling establishments to bring in the same type of gaming machines used at tribal casinos. According to the initiative, the revenue brought in from the additional gaming machines would have been used to reduce state property taxes.In Washington state, 60.63 percent of voters marked no on their ballots, leading to the defeat of the measure. In Yakima County, results were very similar with 60.17 percent of voters against the initiative.Referendum Measure 55The second education measure on the ballot didn't fare much better than the first. Tuesday, voters in Washington voted down Referendum Measure 55, which would have made it possible to establish charter schools in the state.The measure would have made it possible for charter schools to be operated by \"qualified non-profit corporations, under contracts with local education boards.\"</p><p></p><p>The charter schools would have been allocated a certain amount of public funds for operation.Again, the percentage of voters who voted against Referendum 55 in Washington state is almost exactly the same as the percentage of those who voted against it in Yakima County. Across the state, 58.42 percent of voters voted against the measure. In Yakima County, 58.77 percent of voters voted against it.Jim Spady with the Washington Charter School Resource Center noted that he feels the Washington education system is currently in crisis.\"We must do more to help our educationally disadvantaged students,\" Spady said. \"Charter public schools will help these children, but the voters have apparently decided to give the regular public school system more time to solve this crisis on its own.\"Initiative 297One measure voters across the state turned out to support was Initiative 297, which deals with radioactive hazardous waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.The initiative adds new previsions concerning the waste, making it necessary for the waste that is at the site to be cleaned up before any more waste can be brought into the facility.In Yakima County, 61.66 percent of voters voted for the measure, compared to 68.51 percent who approved it across the state.Proposition No. 1Locally, Yakima County voters approved Proposition No. 1, which called for a three-tenth's of a penny increase in the county's sales tax to help fund the area's criminal justice system.</p><p></p><p>The proposition will be in effect for a six-year period before it is brought back to the voters.Throughout Yakima County, 56.04 percent of voters voted for the proposition.The proposition is expected to raise $6.1 million annually for the Yakima County criminal justice system, with the funds being dispersed to law enforcement agencies throughout the county.", "author": "Ellie Olmsen", "type": "News Article", "title": "Washington voters approve new style of primary election", "people": ["Jim Spady", "Spady"], "locations": ["United States", "Washington", "Yakima County", "Hanford Nuclear Reservation"], "organizations": ["State of Washington Voters", "Washington State Voters", "Referendum Measure", "Washington Charter School Resource Center", "Yakima County"], "misc": ["I-872"]}, {"date": "03, Nov 2004", "text": "Kerry concedes Presidential race Tuesday morning</p><p>Story by: John Panni</p><p>Date Published to Web: 11/3/2004</p><p></p><p>It looked as if the country was heading for a repeat of the 2000 Presidential election, but there will be no exhilarating counting of the chads or Supreme Court battles this time around.</p><p></p><p>President George W.

This year when the local drama students take to the stage they may be speaking Shakespearean language, but there will be no denying that the play is set in modern times.For the past two and a half months the more than 30 cast members have been working diligently, learning their lines and preparing to bring Romeo and Juliet to the stage.Drama teacher Maisy Sylling noted that she tries to incorporate a Shakespearean play into the high school's repertoire at least once every four or five years in order to challenge her students to learn the language.As for why she chose to do Romeo and Juliet this year, Sylling said that she feels it's a timeless story and one with which students can relate.</p><p></p><p>However, she did decide to modernize the play a bit, replacing knives and swords with guns and holsters and 16th century garb with modern-day costumes.\"It's more powerful if it's set in present day,\" Sylling said, noting that it makes it easier for students to relate to.Sylling said those sitting in the audience will have a chance to see a show that will make them think about the challenges young people face, especially if they are in love.\"I think they will be wrapped up in the story and impressed by the talent of the high school students,\" she said.The cast of Romeo and Juliet is made up of about 30 students, with another 25 students working behind the scenes. Sylling said this season's play helped attract a lot of new students to the drama program. She noted that for Tony Magana, who will be playing Romeo, this marks the first time he has been on stage. In the past he has worked as a member of the crew. The role of Juliet will be played by Angela Marin.The play is set to take to the stage at 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, Nov. 12 and 13, and Saturday, Nov. 20.

Men wanting their hands or backs hairless also visit her, as do high school aged boys and girls and college students home on vacation.\"As of today, electrolysis is the only method of permanent hair removal that is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration,\" said Roberson. She said plucking, tweezing, creams, waxes and other methods of hair removal don't kill the follicle and instead draw more blood to the area where hair is removed, causing it to grow back thicker and darker.Although some people think that electrolysis is similar to a medical procedure, Roberson is quick to let all know that they are not medical persons, but she added it is not the \"back door business\" people used to think it was.\"We are not medical people ourselves, but we have a lot of medical people talk to us,\" said Roberson.She recently returned from an electrolysis conference in Las Vegas, where she heard from medical professionals on different things to look for on client's skin and was updated on new technologies.Roberson said she often sees or notices changes in moles that a client may not know about.</p><p></p><p>Without diagnosing a skin problem, she may suggest that a client see their doctor about the condition. On a few occasions Roberson's suggestion to go to the doctor has proven to benefit her clients, who were found to have cancerous spots on their faces.Electrolysis by Linda is a second job for Roberson, who does quality control for Stadelman Fruit Company in Zillah. Her Alderwood office hours are in the late afternoon and evening by appointment.\"I give a free consultation to anyone interested,\" said Roberson. \"This is not like getting a shot,\" she tells her clients. \"I go along the hair follicle and use a high frequency heat machine to cook the hair from the inside out.\"Roberson said her clients keep her interested in continuing electrolysis.\"When I see my clients on the street walking with their head high, it makes me feel good,\" said Roberson.", "author": "Mel Sacher", "type": "News Article", "title": "Working Stiff", "people": ["Linda Roberson", "Roberson", "Linda"], "locations": ["Lower Valley", "Seventh Street", "Alderwood", "Edison Avenue", "Yakima", "Mabton", "Las Vegas", "Zillah"], "organizations": ["New Image", "Food and Drug Administration", "Stadelman Fruit Company", "Alderwood"], "misc": []}, {"date": "05, Nov 2004", "text": "Mayor pro-tem suggests regaining control of library</p><p>Story by: John Panni</p><p>Date Published to Web: 11/5/2004</p><p></p><p>During Thursday night's joint meeting of the Alderwood School Board and the Alderwood City Council, Mayor Pro-tem George Greenway offered a suggestion concerning the local library.Greenway wants to enter into discussions with the school district to find a way to take back operation of the Alderwood Public Library from the Yakima Valley Regional Library System.\"We should look at some kind of joint venture between the city and the school district,\" said Greenway.The Alderwood City Council opted during budget discussions last year to put before local voters the issue of whether or not to support an additional 50 per thousand assessed property value tax to keep the library open under the operation of the Yakima Valley Regional Library.

Greenway said the financial figures regional library officials are releasing show that Alderwood residents are paying more into the system than they are getting.\"I think we can take that same 50 and do just as good or better,\" said Greenway.Councilwoman Jennie Angel, who is involved with the Alderwood Library Board, said regional library officials do have a plan in place to improve the local facility. Angel said she would like to see them given the opportunity to improve the facility before any talks of taking back the library happen.</p><p></p><p>Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones didn't rule out such a discussion between the district and the city.

They're just people, acquaintances so to speak, people who don't realize that they're an integrated part of our lives.We all have such people in our lives. Our understanding of them, and their's of us, is superficial. We present what we want them to see.

These aren't the people to whom we vent our built-up frustrations, complain to about the boss at work who's making our lives miserable or chew out for the cruddy dinner that was served up the previous night. No, these are the people we hardly know, yet we are always polite to them, always talk civil to them and always put on our best face for them.Why is it that for these people, the ones we barely know, we can always be on our best? But for the people we count on most in our lives, our family, we treat them shamefully at times? We're not always pleasant with our loved ones...we snarl, we grumble, we complain, we question, we yell, we curse.

The Greyhounds (3-3, 3-6) saw their season come to a close.Grandview was poised several times to take the early lead on the Pioneers' home field, but three first quarter stops by Omak after the 'Hounds had driven the ball deep into Pioneer territory thwarted any such hopes.First year Grandview Coach Dustin Lamb said his club had three red zone scoring opportunities in the opening period. \"But on two of them we had dropped passes in crucial situations, and with the other we had a penalty that backed us up.\"</p><p></p><p>Omak also snuffed a couple of other Grandview drives in the first half when the Pioneers came up with a pair of interceptions.The 'Hounds were forced into playing catch-up football after Omak posted three touchdowns in the second quarter.

The Artz to Vela hook-up cut Omak's lead to 21-12.</p><p></p><p>The Pioneers didn't allow Grandview to get any closer, though. Omak put an insurance touchdown on the scoreboard to account for the final 28-12 score.The Greyhounds put up some decent numbers on offense, despite being limited to two touchdowns on the night.

The video covered the basics of what the students will be learning over the next several weeks as they delve into the clowning world.A form of entertainment that has been around for more than a thousand years, clowns were once known as court jesters.Waggoner said the first step is to learn how to move like a clown.While most people walk and move smoothly, clowns exaggerate their movements, which is important so that people know exactly how they are feeling.Although they will have time to practice later, the students also learned the basics of juggling, which includes starting out with something like a light handkerchief, which will fall slowly. Waggoner said as that becomes easier, begin trying with soft bean bags, which won't roll away if dropped.</p><p></p><p>\"The bottom line is practice,\" said Waggoner.Last night's video also showed the basics of balloon art, clown gags and skits and designing costumes.The students also learned there are three different kinds of clown make-up faces, the white faced clowns, which are the more reserved clowns. Auguste clowns, which have both white and flesh tones, are the roust-abouts and trouble makers, said Waggoner. The third type of clown is the tramp or character clown.Clothes are determined by what kind of clown a person chooses to be.Waggoner said that if his students choose to be a tramp or character clown he wants them to dress nicely instead of in old rags.The key to developing a face and costume is to exaggerate already existing physical characteristics, such as height, length of face and girth.When developing a clown face, the basic circus colors used are red, black, white and blue.Clowns use color on their lower lip only and smiles are generally smaller, not the big scary smiles often created by inexperienced clowns, said Waggoner. Using baby powder, clowns set their make-up so it doesn't run.\"We use plain old baby powder as long as it doesn't have cornstarch in it,\" said Waggoner, adding that they brush off excess powder with a brush.\"After I get my make-up on I can go swimming and it won't come off,\" said Waggoner.The next class will be held Monday, Nov. 15, at the Alderwood Beauty Academy. They will be going over make-up at the next class.</p><p></p><p>Waggoner said it's not too late to sign up for the free classes.

A few of those individuals made very poignant arguments, however, the fact of the matter is this, for every city that has had a bad experience with privatization, there is another that has had a good experience.</p><p>Now, I am not saying that I am either for or against privatization. What I am saying is that the citizens of Alderwood elected me to be their watchdog, to make sure that I make sound fiscal decisions when it comes to using the city's money. In order to do this, I need to be able to look at all aspects of the city's budget. This includes possible privatization.</p><p>Good citizens of Alderwood, I will promise you this, whether or not I vote in favor of privatization, I will never vote for less quality or poorer standards regardless of the cost.</p><p>/s/ John Sarducci, City Councilman, Alderwood</p><p></p><p>Untruths about teachers dont help fix schools</p><p>I have had the privilege of getting to know John Panni over the past couple of years in the capacity as a tennis and basketball coach. He does a great job covering our local teams and I find him very likable on a personal level. I was, however, disappointed at some of the things he said in his personal column titled \"Election night headache\" (11-3-04).</p><p>I also voted against I-884 because I don't think throwing more money at the education problem is the answer. I would like to see the education system use existing money more effectively. In that sense I agree with Mr. Panni.</p><p>However, Mr. Panni's discussion of teachers wanting more pay is very off base. He notes that teachers \"work a six-hour day, only work 180 days out of each year, and get to work with children.\" One part of that statement is true, we do get to work with children. This can be a great joy, but it can also be a tremendous struggle to have 150 kids that you are responsible for on multiple levels.</p><p>As a teacher, I take issue with Mr. Panni's comments regarding teacher work hours. The contract for teachers in Alderwood requires that we be at work from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily. If my math is correct, that's seven and a half hours a day, not six. I don't know very many teachers who keep that schedule. Mr. Panni might want to look at the sign-in sheet at the high school, or others for that matter, so he can see the hours that teachers come in to do work for which they are not paid. As a teacher, a 50-hour work week is not uncommon. I have had many full time jobs in my life. Teaching is the most time consuming, mentally taxing and rewarding job of them all!</p><p>When I got into this profession, money was not a deciding factor. I wanted to have time in the summer to spend with my family. What a dream that was! Not only is my summer taken up with preparing for the next school year, I am required by the state (at my expense) to increase my education. When do you think that is done? So why is there a teaching shortage in many parts of this country?</p><p>The way Mr. Panni described it, you'd think everyone would want to teach. So, here is an open invitation. If being a teacher, advisor and mentor to 150 students daily on a $30,000 a year salary appeals to you, then this is a great job. Oh, you have to use your summers to continue your education on your dime (about $10,000 for me so far in my fourth year).</p><p>I love my job and wouldn't trade it for any career. I chose it over law school because of my passion for it. It's just frustrating to read misconceptions like John Panni's, because teachers give their all to a system that has rules that they must live under. Fixing the system should be a priority, but promoting untruths about a teacher's job doesn't help.</p><p>/s/ Troy Whittle, Alderwood High School social studies teacher</p><p></p><p>Dont destroyour rec programs</p><p>I was dismayed to hear that the city manager plans to eliminate the position of parks and recreation manager and divide the responsibilities of that job between the park supervisor and the secretary of the parks and recreation department. Do you believe these two individuals can handle their own duties, plus supervise the community center, museum, senior center, swimming pool, organize the children's soccer and baseball teams and organize the special craft and recreation programs for adults?</p><p>As an example of one event, last year I volunteered to help with the summer track meet. There were 300 participants. This event was held on a Saturday. Would the parks and recreation secretary or park supervisor be able to organize and run all of these track events and also do their regular duties?</p><p>The parks and recreation manager is responsible for the swimming pool programs, events at the senior center and the management of the sports leagues by assigning fields and organizing games. Will the department secretary and park supervisor be able to know what strokes should be taught in the different classifications of swimming classes? Besides their regular duties, will they be able to check on all the sports leagues and their field assignments and organize the league? Will they be present at the senior citizens casino night and participate as dealers?</p><p>The citizens of Alderwood deserve a well organized recreational program that meets the needs of all ages. These activities provide outlets to many who would otherwise not have these advantages. When these programs decline, we will have more juvenile problems and associated negative behaviors.</p><p>Please join me in opposing the decision of the city manager to destroy our progressive recreational program for all people in the city of Alderwood.</p><p>/s/ Dorothy L.

Eyman said he believes people should be continuously active in making decisions that affect their everyday lives.</p><p></p><p>This got me thinking. Shouldn't that be the same for city government? Shouldn't we have a say in what happens with our city services, such as the ambulance? Especially when the council doesn't necessarily represent the opinions of the community.</p><p></p><p>There has been talk of privatizing the Alderwood ambulance service for months. I haven't heard one person (except for the city council) say, \"Yes! Let's get rid of the ambulance service!\"</p><p></p><p>In the time I've been with this newspaper I've never heard anyone complain that the ambulance service in this town is not doing its job. I've heard plenty of complaints about neighboring communities' private ambulance services.</p><p></p><p>I haven't always worked in a community with a public ambulance service. When living in Newport, Ore. the county was serviced by a private ambulance service. They had a large, beautiful station that they responded from and answered calls at all points of the county. The service even had a satellite office to help minimize the response time to calls.</p><p></p><p>What sticks out in my mind is one of the last major accidents I covered while living in Newport. The accident occurred in Lincoln City on Highway 101. The ambulance showed up to assist the fire department and haul the injured to the hospital for treatment. The ambulance, which was the only one available for this major accident, left the scene, but they were not able to haul all of the injured, so they left a man behind in the road bleeding.</p><p></p><p>The man didn't need a backboard or any other kind of special apparatus, but since his car was totaled he did need a ride.</p><p>Not knowing how long the ambulance would be, the city firefighters/emergency workers gave the man a ride to the hospital, where he was treated.</p><p>For those who don't know, there is a lot of paperwork the emergency medical technicians and paramedics have to do once they reach the hospital. Some times they are tied up for quite some time. The city emergency workers at this particular accident had no idea how long it would be before another ambulance arrived on scene.</p><p></p><p>The next thing you know, the city was being sued by the ambulance service. The reason they sued was because of a loss of revenue. The company lost the money it would have billed the man for the ride to the hospital.</p><p>Is that what we want? Do we want the ambulance service and city in a situation where they could be sued because an outside company lost money due to a lack of responders?</p><p></p><p>Ambulance services are often called \"first responders,\" which would indicate that they are some of the first people on the scene of an accident or at a medical emergency call. But that isn't always the case.</p><p>When speaking to a Grandview resident, she said the Alderwood ambulance service arrived at her home for a medical emergency before her local private service. She now wants her family to call Alderwood first if any other medical emergencies arise at her house.</p><p>If that's what we have in store with a private ambulance service, and if you look back at the history of Alderwood before the start of the public service, you would find similar tales, than I, for one, don't want it!</p><p>Why is it that the best services offered by this town are on the city council's chopping block? That makes no sense! Financially speaking, the council may think it looks good on paper, but we're talking about the quality of life for the whole community.</p><p></p><p>For a council that says it is so concerned with quality of life issues, why don't they look at some of the basic ones, such as the police, fire, water, sewer and parks and recreation. These are all services that are better when the community has direct control over them, not when they are farmed out to some conglomerate, whose first concern is the bottom line.</p><p></p><p>The council may not see these departments as offering quality of life services, but I tell you what, if it came down to whether I want a proven ambulance service available to tend to my emergency needs or spending taxpayer money on the removal of a feed lot, I think I'll opt for the ambulance service that's currently in place.</p><p></p><p>I think that what the council is forgetting is that quality of life is just that...it's living. The living, breathing, walking people of this community are what are important. Sure, it would be great if we didn't have the cow smell that wafts into town every once in a while, but if we don't have the critical services to help the people of the community, then why are we living here?", "author": "Mel Sacher", "type": "News Article", "title": "Beyond The Norm-Mel", "people": ["Tim Eyman", "Eyman"], "locations": ["Washington", "Newport", "Lincoln City", "Grandview"], "organizations": ["University of Washington", "Alderwood"], "misc": []}]}, {"date": "2004-11-11 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "11, Nov 2004", "text": "2005 will bring many changes for Alderwood's parks department</p><p>Story by: John Panni</p><p>Date Published to Web: 11/11/2004</p><p></p><p>Alderwood Parks and Recreation Director Don Stiles made what will almost certainly be his last budget presentation to the Alderwood City Council during its study session on Wednesday night.</p><p></p><p>As part of cuts in the 2005 budget to help make-up for a $393,910 shortfall, City Manager Tom Rockford proposed to Council to eliminate Stiles' position. The position cut will result in a $25,000 savings for the city.</p><p></p><p>But Stiles found an ally during Wednesday night's study session in Councilman Raul Martinez. Martinez said he would like to comb through the budget to find the $25,000 to keep Stiles, saying the position was important to the parks department.</p><p></p><p>\"If we can find the funds as we comb through the budget, I would opt to keep a director,\" said Martinez.</p><p></p><p>Prior to discussing Stiles' position, Council sifted through the 2005 budget requests for the parks department. An added expense in 2005 is the unforeseen duty to operate the community center next year.</p><p></p><p>The city will take back control of the community center because the Washington State Migrant Council, which is currently managing the facility, terminated its contract. The city assumes control of the community center Dec. 1. Plans are to locate the parks and recreation department at the community center, said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>Why the city is in such a quandary with the community center, said Rockford, is that under the terms of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) the city obtained for construction of the community center, officials have to keep the building open to the public.</p><p></p><p>\"The difficulty we face here is having this thrust upon us when we really don't have the ability to say no,\" said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>The proposed 2005 budget for the parks department totals $530,270. Operating the community center will add an additional $63,180 in expenses. Rockford and Finance Director Chad Stotz estimate it will cost the city $73,180 to operate the community center in 2005, but the figure was reduced because the city is using $10,000 it already has available in the budget to operate the facility. The city is anticipating $53,400 in revenue from the community center in 2005.</p><p></p><p>Parks and rec salaries in 2005 will total $267,160, down from $272,630 in 2004. Under the proposed budget, Stiles will lose his position as parks director. This will result in the creation of a parks and recreation coordinator. The city will then hire a recreation assistant.</p><p></p><p>Rockford said it was a difficult decision to cut the parks and recreation director position.</p><p></p><p>Focusing on the community center, Stiles explained that to maintain the staffing the Migrant Council has had at the community center, it will cost the city $25,560. Stiles said the city could help fund some of those positions by continuing catering services at the center. Stiles is speculating the city could raise $12,000 next year in catering.</p><p></p><p>Councilman John Torch wanted to look at partnering with the school district to possibly hire someone to oversee the community center and the operation of other venues in the community.</p><p></p><p>\"I feel like all we are going to do at best is keep the doors open at the community center,\" said Torch.</p><p></p><p>Torch said the problem with the city proposal is that the parks and recreation staff will be busy doing their duties and have no time to operate the center.</p><p></p><p>Rockford said one area the Migrant Council was successful in was obtaining volunteers at the community center. Rockford is hoping to establish a strong volunteer base. Rockford acknowledged that the next year will be a learning experience for operating the community center.</p><p></p><p>Mayor Rex Luthor wanted to continue to look at partnerships, but suggested Council move forward with adopting the proposed budget.</p><p></p><p>Much like Martinez, Torch was cautious about having the position of recreation coordinator be in charge of parks and recreation duties. Torch said he would like to look through the parks budget for extra revenue funds.</p><p></p><p>Stiles ended the evening with a few comments for Council. Stiles said he doesn't agree 100 percent with the decision by Rockford to eliminate his position. Stiles nixed a suggestion that he serves as director of the community center. If Council does decide to eliminate his position, Stiles told Council that after 17 plus years working as parks director it would be hard for him to relinquish the role.</p><p></p><p>\"It is going to be a challenge, but there are some things I am looking at,\" said Stiles. \"I appreciate the opportunity to have worked for the City of Alderwood.\"</p><p></p><p>There are two other areas that fall within the parks and recreation budget-the Alderwood Museum and the Alderwood Senior Center. These two items are reviewed as separate budget areas.</p><p></p><p>The city was able to free up some extra money after relinquishing control of the library to the Yakima Regional Library System.</p><p></p><p>Maintenance and custodial work for the local library fell under control of the Alderwood parks department.</p><p></p><p>As a result of giving up operation of the library, Rockford in the 2005 preliminary budget spread around the duties of the custodian that cleaned the library. This results in a little less than $4,000 salary increase for the custodian cleaning the museum.</p><p></p><p>The budget for the Alderwood Senior Center, which is also a separate item from the actual parks and recreation budget, will see a minimal increase in its 2005 budget because of additional custodial work.

He encouraged staff to weather the storm and said hopefully things will improve in the future.</p><p></p><p>The budget for the Alderwood Fire Department is divided into three categories-fire control, fire equipment and emergency medical service/ambulance.</p><p></p><p>Prior to delving into the budget, Rockford provided Council with some history of how the city has improved the revenue stream for the fire department.</p><p></p><p>Rockford has revamped the ambulance utility tax fee that was ruled unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court earlier this year. Prior to the ruling by the high court, the city was charging a $3 tax on residents' water and sewer bills. Alderwood voters had approved the tax shortly after the fire department began offering an ambulance service in 1990. Alderwood stopped collecting the tax shortly after the ruling by the court earlier this year.</p><p></p><p>The new version of the ambulance utility fee tax will keep the $3 per month fee, but the amount will now be charged to both residents and businesses. The fee is calculated on the average number of residents living in a home in Alderwood, 3.6. Every business will be charged based on the 3.6 employees ratio up to 100 employees. The new fee will generate $350,000, said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>Rockford was able to clear up $70,000 in additional money for the fire department by moving expenses over to the ambulance fund.</p><p></p><p>The proposed 2005 fire control budget is $595,410, down considerably from the $639,220 budget in 2004.</p><p></p><p>A majority of the fire control budget, $295,480, covers the salaries for the 13 positions within the department. The budget does contain a one-time expense of $6,000 to replace a failing boiler.</p><p></p><p>One area of significant increase is in overtime. In 2004, the city spent $13,370 in the fire control budget for overtime. That figure will rise to $31,306 in 2005. Rockford said overtime expenses are being paid for through a grant the city received. The overtime will go towards training for staff and the 22 members of the volunteer fire department.</p><p></p><p>A significant change in the fire department budget is the elimination of two firefighter/paramedic positions. There are currently two staff members serving in the military in Iraq, who are scheduled to return to work next year. Rockford said under the terms of the labor contract the city's fire staff has, the employees with least seniority will be laid off first. One of the positions being proposed for elimination is held by Jamel Linzsey, who is serving in Iraq. The other fireman serving in Iraq is Gregg Hutchinson, who has the most seniority of the two firefighters.</p><p></p><p>Rockford presented a proposal to Council regarding layoffs. Rockford said that since Linzsey is scheduled to come home from active duty at the beginning of the year, he asked Council to fund Linzsey's position until the time Hutchinson returns from Iraq. Once Hutchinson returns, Linzsey will be laid off from the fire department. The other position set to be cut is that of Josh Roe.</p><p></p><p>Councilwoman Jennie Angel was concerned about laying off any of the firefighters. Interim Fire Chief Adam Dent did acknowledge the fire department has managed without the two staff members serving in Iraq. Dent, though, did say that without a full staff it does make it difficult to provide needed services. Dent said he likes to have four staff members on call each of the 24-hour shifts.</p><p></p><p>\"We try to provide the highest level of service to everybody in the community at the same time,\" said Dent.</p><p></p><p>Angel asked how much it would cost to fund a firefighter/paramedic position. Rockford said in the neighborhood of $65,00, including benefits.</p><p></p><p>Mayor Rex Luthor agreed with Angel with her concerns about reducing the staff.</p><p></p><p>\"I am nervous losing this large of a percentage of people providing a critical service in the community,\" said Luthor.</p><p></p><p>Fire Captain Tom Siliano wasn't so optimistic about the department being able to do its job not fully staffed.</p><p></p><p>\"It is actually a living hell to be running short,\" said Siliano.</p><p></p><p>Siliano said it has been difficult for the captains to do their jobs without a full crew. Siliano expressed concerns about not replacing the fire marshal position, which Dent used to hold. Siliano said those duties, which include conducting fire inspections, will now fall on the captains. Siliano said with more time by the captains being dedicated to fire inspections, there will be less time for important department activities, such as training and being available to fight fires.</p><p></p><p>Councilman John Torch suggested the captains schedule appointments for fire inspections. Siliano said the idea is good in concept, but it won't work. Siliano said it is better to show up unexpectedly, which will reveal more problems and in the end assist the business owners in setting up a safer work environment.</p><p></p><p>Siliano said when conducting a fire inspection it is important to see business owners in their every day work environment.</p><p></p><p>Rockford interjected and offered a few comments about the fire department.</p><p></p><p>\"All we expect you to do is do what you can do,\" said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>Rockford said by taking action now with the budget cuts, the city will be talking about what to do with increased revenues he is projecting down the road in just a few years.</p><p></p><p>The city is getting along now with three less department heads, said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>\"Are we taking some risks?,\" asked Rockford. \"What choice do we have.\"</p><p></p><p>The fire equipment reserve fund budget is $163,00 in 2005, up from $148,200 in 2004. The increase is mainly due to $131,000 in grant monies the department received.</p><p></p><p>The EMS/ambulance fund is budgeted at $998,990, which is up from $890,000 in 2004. Salaries account for $449,630 of the budget. The salaries for the fire department are split between EMS and the fire control budgets. The EMS budget will start 2005 with a beginning fund balance of $250,000 and end with a projected balance of $269,580.</p><p></p><p>Councilman Tom Seeger wanted to look into the relationship the city has with Alderwood County Fire District #5. Seeger's concerns dealt with the city firemen, who are also county volunteers, responding to a fire outside city limits. Seeger said he was concerned the city wasn't receiving any compensation for the hours spent fighting county fires.</p><p></p><p>Councilman John Torch wanted to once again begin the discussion about regionalizing county fire department services.</p><p></p><p>\"Why don't we start waving our flag,\" said Torch. \"We are the premiere guys.\"</p><p>", "author": "John Panni", "type": "News Article", "title": "Fire captains air concerns with 2005 budget cuts", "people": ["Tom Siliano", "Bud Jones-were", "Jamel Linzsey", "Gregg Hutchinson", "Linzsey", "Hutchinson", "Josh Roe", "Adam Dent", "Angel", "Mayor Rex Luthor", "Luthor", "Siliano", "John Torch", "Tom Seeger", "Seeger"], "locations": ["Rockford", "Alderwood", "Iraq"], "organizations": ["Alderwood Fire Department- Yan Sing", "Alderwood City Council", "Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford", "Alderwood Fire Department", "Council", "Supreme Court", "Alderwood", "Rockford", "Linzsey", "Alderwood County Fire District"], "misc": ["Councilwoman Jennie Angel"]}]}, {"date": "2004-11-16 00:00:00", "articles": [{"date": "16, Nov 2004", "text": "City Council's 2005 budget relatively unchanged</p><p>Story by: John Panni</p><p>Date Published to Web: 11/16/2004</p><p></p><p>The Alderwood City Council spent Monday night's 2005 budget study session combing through several department budgets, including the legislative fund.</p><p>The legislative fund is allocated for Council operations.

Steve Evans and the other two from two patrol officers leaving for other positions.</p><p></p><p>\"No one currently employed is going to be losing their jobs,\" said Mana.</p><p></p><p>Mana told Council he wants to use the county tax money to hire an officer at the beginning of the year. This will allow the department to retain the traffic officer position, which is currently being held by Kent Coffman. Without hiring an additonal officer at the beginning of the year, Coffman's services would have had to be used elsewhere in the department to cover vacancies.</p><p></p><p>\"We believe that is an important enough function,\" said Mana.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the year, Mana plans to hire another officer in hopes of providing the detectives division with some additional assistance. Also at mid-year, Mana plans to create an administrative secretary position, replacing a data entry person that will be leaving.</p><p></p><p>The proposed law enforcement budget for 2005 is $2.1 million.</p><p></p><p>The major expenditure in this department is salaries, $1.2 million.</p><p></p><p>Rockford told Council Tuesday night about a plan he has to lease police vehicles in 2005. As a result, Council was able to take $35,000 from the $163,760 set aside in the line item for other services and charges. The $35,000 will now go to help operate the Alderwood Community Center, said Rockford.</p><p></p><p>One significant expenditure in the law enforcement budget deals with overtime. For 2005, Mana has set aside $92,000 for overtime, which is up considerably from $56,420 in 2004. The 2004 amount was based in part on a strong desire by Council to reduce the overtime budget. In 2003, the police department had an overtime budget of $103,395. Mana said his overtime budget is based on past usage. The most difficult problem with overtime in the police department, said Mana, is having to fill positions when staff members are gone. Mana said the amount being set aside for overtime is still less than it would cost to hire people for the actual positions.</p><p></p><p>Of the 34 current staff members at the police department, Mana said 22 of those are commissioned officers. The police department is currently at staffing levels for officers that it had in 1991, the chief told Council.</p><p></p><p>Councilman Tom Seeger said he was worried about how overtime would be affected once the new dispatch center at the law and justice center is completed by the middle of next year. Mana said overtime will be a concern at the new center.</p><p></p><p>However, the city will be having some new revenue from housing prisoners that will assist in paying for overtime expenses, said Mana. The United States Marshal Service is closing some of its locations around the state and will now be using the Alderwood jail to house prisoners.</p><p></p><p>Seeger was also concerned with the city's involvement with the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA), a program operated by the Washington State Patrol. . The police department currently dedicates one office to working with HIDTA. Mana said there is benefits to the partnership, such as having an officer working with HIDTA on a full-time basis. Seeger wanted to see what kind of cost benefits there is to the city to continue this partnership.</p><p></p><p>Seeger was also curious about the partnership the city has with the school district for funding the two school resource officers. Mana said the school district has increased its funding for the positions to $100,000 annually. The city pays about one-third of the costs to have the officers in the schools. The police department gets the services of the two officers back during the summer months. Mana said an issue is that during the summer months, the officers usually take their vacation, so there is no real benefit to the city.</p><p></p><p>The budget for the corrections department is a separate item. The proposed 2005 corrections department budget is $537,410, which is an increase from the $516,010 budgeted in 2004. The increase in the budget comes under the line item for supplies, which increases from $97,300 in 2004 to $157,500 in 2005. Captain Bill Bank said the primary expenses in supplies are the meals for prisoners and cleaning supplies. Bank said the corrections budget is a conservative estimate of where it should be.</p><p></p><p>The proposed communications department budget at the police department is $492,190 for 2005.

Until the sixties, the food we ate and how we chose to eat was neutral territory. Not any longer.</p><p></p><p>The way food is raised, processed and ingested is an integral part of our nation's politics, spawning movements and reflecting media bias. The November issue of Vanity Fair magazine is no exception, rather another alarming example of undisciplined journalism, with an underlying political motive to discredit our nation's beef industry in response to their donations to the Republican Party.</p><p></p><p>Since beef producers and Greenways in general don't reside in Vanity Fair's predominantly urban circulation areas, it is imperative they are made aware of the glaring cover currently being read this month in grocery lines across America that states \"America's Beef is Rotten and Washington Couldn't Care Less.\" Inside is a half page color photo of a very frightened cow with the caption, \"Order the Fish.\" When assertions like this are made, in their sites are the big guns, i.e...fast food restaurants like McDonald's, agri-business conglomerates, the National Restaurant Association and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Sadly, the power of some glib headline impacts those with the most to lose, good ranching families responsible for providing the steaks and hamburgers that have become America's dining heritage.</p><p></p><p>The author, Eric Schlosser, known for his searing expose, \"Fast Food Nation, The Dark side of the all-American Meal,\" masterfully uses E. coli, mad- cow and salmonella to trump up unwarranted fear about beef. In this era of terrorism, he calls BSE America's most \"serious\" food-safety threat, despite the fact that the one B.S.E. infected bovine in Washington state was quickly isolated without an incident. The article even insinuates that there might be a conspiracy theory within the USDA testing program designed not to find BSE.</p><p></p><p>In a lengthy paragraph Schlosser callously sensationalizes the final physical moments of a child's death from E-coli poisoning, attributing it to a hamburger when the evidence was inconclusive, conveniently omitting the fact that bagged lettuce was the source of 28 cases of school children infected with e-coli just last year and 50 teens in 2002. I find it interesting that green onions were notably absent on the November 2003 cover of Vanity Fair, given the fact that a year ago three people died and 510 people contracted hepatitis A from eating green onions imported from Mexico. Did Vanity Fair cover the recent outbreak of E-coli in organic strawberries and lettuce with the same aplomb as they did beef? Unfortunately, we all know the answer.</p><p></p><p>It is obvious by tracking buying habits that consumers don't believe America's beef is \"rotten,\" rather they are appreciative of the branding, pricing and selection now available in their local food sources. It is time to stop politicizing food! As agtivists,, we can show support for America's Greenways and ranchers by boycotting publications that practice irresponsible journalism and refusing to buy the products advertised in them.</p><p></p><p>Suzie Loffer represents the Food forethought organization that is an advocate for the agricultural industry.", "author": "", "type": "Auxiliary Article", "title": "Food Fore Thought", "people": ["Suzie Loffer", "Greenways", "Donald", "Eric Schlosser", "E. coli", "B.
