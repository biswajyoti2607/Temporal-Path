The Mad Cow syndrome had consigned<br />us to a bleak future.  It was in my junior year in high school that my passage into the adult world<br />took place. I was working part time in the afternoon at a gas station and attending school in the<br />morning. My friend James worked the station in the morning and attended class in the afternoon. We<br />also hung around with a kid named Alan that we nicknamed Squirt. Squirt was taller than either James<br />or I, but his whole nature, well, suffice it to say he was Squirt. Squirt was a year younger than us<br />and was, I guess, a nerd. But he was likeable, and took no offense at our ribbing. He seemed proud of<br />his new nickname, never having one before. Squirt was hanging out one day after school, when he asked<br />James and I if we had ever been inside a missile silo. Though I was a lifelong Alderwood resident, I<br />was only vaguely aware of the missile silo. James had lived in the town for less than two years, was<br />completely unaware of the cold war legacy left by Army: an abandoned Nike missle silo in the hills.<br />Squirt said he had a maps to the silo and had heard that we could get in there to party. We were<br />always looking for something new to do. James was the only one who had a girlfriend (to be truthful,<br />the only one who had been on a date) but this Friday she would be out of town, so it was agreed Friday<br />night we would go to the missile base and see if we could get inside.<br /><br />We made little preparation for the trip to the silo, about a half tank of gas in my old 52 Chevy, and<br />a few candles to light our way. According to the map, the silo we were going to was about 30 miles<br />west of town in the hills. We thought it best to go after 10p.m. to have less chance of being seen. We<br />also thought secrecy was best, so no one knew what we were about to try.<br /><br />The silo had not been in use for a few years and the last thing I could recall was that they had been<br />'salvaged' or stripped of the equipment and valuable metals. Squirt and I had discussed the issue of<br />breaking in. We had agreed that we would not 'Break in', but if it was open, as he was told, then we<br />would go.<br /><br />About 10p.m., James and I picked up Squirt and the three of us headed out. It was November and the<br />desert air was very clear and cold. The fall night sky in Washington with no moon can justifiably be<br />called beautiful. A pure blackness broken only by the stars, many, many stars. It was nearly 11p.m.<br />when we came to the road that turned north. A car was coming so we had to pass the road and wait<br />several minutes until the car was out of sight.<br /><br />The road to the silo was short and we soon came to a front gate. It was locked securely, but we could<br />see where others had driven to the left and around the front fence. The silo was surrounded by an<br />eight-foot chain link fence with razor wire on the top. Following the rough road around the fence we<br />found ourselves behind a large mound of dirt, completely blocked from view of anyone passing on the<br />road. This was good, as I had been worried about someone seeing the car.<br /><br />We got out of the car and even though there was no moon, we could see fairly well, our eyes adjusting<br />quickly to the dark. Slowly walking around the mound of dirt we could see the back fence. There was<br />little traffic on the highway with only an occasional car passing. When one did happen by, Squirt,<br />James, and I would get very still hoping we wouldn't be seen. After a few minutes of walking along the<br />fence we found a breach in the chain link, where someone had cut the fence. It was large enough for us<br />to squeeze through. If caught now, we would be trespassing at the very least.<br /><br />Crossing the distance to the aboveground bunker carefully to avoid various pipes and concrete that<br />could trip us took several more minutes, what with stopping every time a car passed. Other than the<br />fence the bunker or entry to the silo was the only thing visible from the road. It stood about nine<br />feet tall, square on the end you entered, and sloping on the opposite side. It was made from concrete<br />that looked to be about nine inches thick. In the darkness it was only a shadow.<br /><br />The door to the bunker was broken open. It had been welded shut, but someone had cut the welds. James<br />opened the door and one by one we stepped in to the blackness. Nervously James struck a match,<br />lighting a candle. A staircase led downward.<br /><br />'I don't know about this, guys,' I said. 'You know we're breaking the law.'<br /><br />Squirt remained silent, but James was adamant. 'We've come this far,' he said. 'No one cares that<br />we're here. No one knows we're here and no one will find out. Hell, they probably wouldn't care if<br />they knew. It's plain someone else has broken in before us, and took their time.'<br /><br />'Okay, okay,' I said. 'Let's go.'<br /><br />From where we were in the entryway we could not see how far the corridor led down. The dim light from<br />James' candle showed a narrow corridor leading down. After a few steps we could see a landing, but<br />nothing beyond that.<br /><br />James went first, Squirt second, and me following. James went almost gleefully down, while Squirt and<br />I followed more slowly. James was the daredevil, always looking for excitement. I think that's why I<br />liked him. At the landing we could see at the bottom of some more steps a wall and a right turn in the<br />corridor. We were obviously below ground level at this point, but just so. James led the way around<br />several corners as Squirt and I lit our candles.<br /><br />'Man, it stinks down here,' said James. About that time the strong musty smell caught us. It was<br /> getting warmer, too.<br /><br />James had moved into what appeared to be a small holding area with steel doors on either end. Squirt,<br />now our resident missile silo expert, said, 'This was a security area. One door was always locked, and<br />the area monitored from below, by closed circuit television.' After that he kept up a running dialog<br />about the missile bases. I was skeptical that he knew what he was talking about, but I didn't know<br />enough to challenge him on it.<br /><br />We passed through several more areas on the same level before heading further down the stairs. I<br />noticed that the air was getting heavier, more humid, but we were getting used to the smell. The<br />stairs were metal and were showing some rustiness. Two more flights down, we came to a large room. The<br />candlelight flickering past pipes, plumbing, electrical conduits, bare wires, and vents made for lots<br />of shadows, making the ceiling, still high above us, seem perilously close. It was clear to us that<br />flashlights would have been much better than the candles. The candles were only making the place seem<br />more sinister, like a crypt or mausoleum. It occurred to me that this was more like descending into<br />the world of the Morlocks in The Time Machine than going into a cave.<br /><br />The welded-shut blast doors had been reopened by past visitors.<br /><br />We took the stairs down another level, passed through a blast door and entered a tunnel made from what<br />looked like a corrugated drain pipe about seven or eight feet in diameter with a narrow concrete path<br />poured in the bottom. At the end we found a closed blast door. It did not look to be welded but the<br />latch was closed. Turning the wheel that lifted the latch was not hard but made a horrific screeching<br />sound in the quiet of the missile base. The sound echoed from both beyond the door and behind us. We<br />stopped and listened for several minutes, I guess expecting someone to catch us and stop us from what<br />now appeared total folly. We were all shivering, but not from temperature. For my part, fear. Squirt,<br />undoubtedly fear. James, I think, from anticipation.<br /><br />This door did not move so easily. We all had to pull it, a few ear-splitting inches at a time. When we<br />entered the next area, thinking it would be the silo, we were met by yet another blast door. It was<br />unlatched and wide open. Beyond it all we could see was more of the awful blackness. This area also<br />had the metal grate, and below the grate was water. Unusual in the desert, to have water standing in<br />an abandoned building. 'The silo must be in there,' said James. Thinking back on it now, James<br />suddenly did not seem so anxious to go in, but go in he did, and Squirt and I followed.<br /><br />Now we were in much larger room. The ceiling was a full 30 feet up, and barely visible in the<br />flickering candle light. The massive doors that opened to fire the missile were visible, as were the<br />mounts for the gigantic hydraulic cylinders that opened the doors. Everything in here was huge. The<br />far wall was not visible. We stood there silent for a time, then moved to the left. As we walked the<br />floor set into a slight thrumming vibration, just from our movement. As we rounded the silo we found<br />the shaft for a service elevator, marked Level 2.<br /><br />I wanted to leave, but James and Squirt wanted to find a way to go down. With all the candles held a<br />certain way we could just make out a spiral staircase leading down, on the other side of the silo, on<br />the level just below us. The floors or 'levels' did not extend across the silo, only extending about<br />15 feet into the silo, and going about two-thirds of the way around. The empty space in the silo was<br />for a Nike Anti-Aircraft Missile.<br /><br /> 'How do we get down to the next level, guys?' asked James.<br /> 'I don't think we can,' I said. 'Maybe we should leave and come back later with a ladder or<br /> something.'<br /> 'Let's keep looking. If we can get to the staircase we can go to the bottom,' said James.<br /> 'James, there is no way to get down there, if we jumped down to the next level we couldn't get back<br /> up,' said Squirt.<br /> 'I agree, James, there just isn't any way.'<br /> 'Look, if we find a way will you guys go with me?' asked James.<br /> Confident there was no way, I said 'Sure' and Squirt also agreed.<br /> 'Okay, let's look around,' said James. I went back toward the elevator, James was looking at the silo<br /> wall, and Squirt was looking down near the right hand side of the blast door....<br /><br /> <<<incomplete document>>>", "FARC": "South American Terrorist Organizations <br />Date Published to Web: 7/14/2004<br /><br />FactSheet: Overview of South American Terrorist Organizations <br /><br />United Self-Defense Forces/Group of Colombia (AUCAutodefensas Unidas de Colombia)<br />Description <br />The AUCcommonly referred to as the paramilitariesis an umbrella organization formed in April 1997 to consolidate most local and regional paramilitary groups each with the mission to protect economic interests and combat insurgents locally.

Aims to establish a Marxist regime and to rid Peru of all imperialist elements (primarily US and Japanese influence). Peru's counterterrorist program has diminished the group's ability to carry out terrorist attacks, and the MRTA has suffered from infighting, the imprisonment or deaths of senior leaders, and loss of leftist support. In 2001, several MRTA members remained imprisoned in Bolivia. <br />Activities<br />Previously conducted bombings, kidnappings, ambushes, and assassinations, but recent activity has fallen drastically. In December 1996, 14 MRTA members occupied the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima and held 72 hostages for more than four months. Peruvian forces stormed the residence in April 1997 rescuing all but one of the remaining hostages and killing all 14 group members, including the remaining leaders. The group has not conducted a significant terrorist operation since and appears more focused on obtaining the release of imprisoned MRTA members. <br />Strength<br />Believed to be no more than 100 members, consisting largely of young fighters who lack leadership skills and experience.<br />Location/Area of Operation<br />Peru with supporters throughout Latin America and Western Europe.

These kinds of agents are called vesicants or blistering agents, because they cause blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. <br />Sulfur mustard is also known as mustard gas or mustard agent, or by the military designations H, HD, and HT. <br />Sulfur mustard sometimes smells like garlic, onions, or mustard and sometimes has no odor. It can be a vapor (the gaseous form of a liquid), an oily-textured liquid, or a solid. <br />Sulfur mustard can be clear to yellow or brown when it is in liquid or solid form. <br /><br />Where sulfur mustard is found and how it is used<br />Sulfur mustard is not found naturally in the environment. <br />Sulfur mustard was introduced in World War I as a chemical warfare agent. Until recently, it was available for use in the treatment of a skin condition called psoriasis. Currently, it has no medical use. <br /><br />How people can be exposed to sulfur mustard<br />If sulfur mustard is released into the air as a vapor, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing. Sulfur mustard vapor can be carried long distances by wind. <br />If sulfur mustard is released into water, people can be exposed by drinking the contaminated water or getting it on their skin. <br />People can be exposed by coming in contact with liquid sulfur mustard. <br />Sulfur mustard can last from 1 to 2 days in the environment under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. <br />Sulfur mustard breaks down slowly in the body, so repeated exposure may have a cumulative effect (that is, it can build up in the body). <br /><br />How sulfur mustard works<br />Adverse health effects caused by sulfur mustard depend on the amount people are exposed to, the route of exposure, and the length of time that people are exposed. <br />Sulfur mustard is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. <br />It damages DNA, a vital component of cells in the body. <br />Sulfur mustard vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas. <br /><br />Immediate signs and symptoms of sulfur mustard exposure<br />Exposure to sulfur mustard is usually not fatal. When sulfur mustard was used during World War I, it killed fewer than 5% of the people who were exposed and got medical care. <br />People may not know right away that they have been exposed, because sulfur mustard often has no smell or has a smell that might not cause alarm. <br />Typically, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. Depending on the severity of the exposure, symptoms may not occur for 2 to 24 hours. Some people are more sensitive to sulfur mustard than are other people, and may have symptoms sooner. <br />Sulfur mustard can have the following effects on specific parts of the body: <br />oSkin: redness and itching of the skin may occur 2 to 48 hours after exposure and change eventually to yellow blistering of the skin. <br />oEyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur within 3 to12 hours of a mild to moderate exposure. A severe exposure may cause symptoms within 1 to 2 hours and may include the symptoms of a mild or moderate exposure plus light sensitivity, severe pain, or blindness (lasting up to 10 days). <br />oRespiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough within 12 to 24 hours of a mild exposure and within 2 to 4 hours of a severe exposure. <br />oDigestive tract: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. <br />Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to sulfur mustard. <br /><br />What the long-term health effects may be<br />Exposure to sulfur mustard liquid is more likely to produce second- and third- degree burns and later scarring than is exposure to sulfur mustard vapor. Extensive skin burning can be fatal. <br />Extensive breathing in of the vapors can cause chronic respiratory disease, repeated respiratory infections, or death. <br />Extensive eye exposure can cause permanent blindness. <br />Exposure to sulfur mustard may increase a persons risk for lung and respiratory cancer. <br /><br />How people can protect themselves and what they should do if they are exposed to sulfur mustard<br />Because no antidote exists for sulfur mustard exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. Immediately leave the area where the sulfur mustard was released. Try to find higher ground, because sulfur mustard is heavier than air and will settle in low-lying areas. <br />If avoiding sulfur mustard exposure is not possible, rapidly remove the sulfur mustard from the body. Getting the sulfur mustard off as soon as possible after exposure is the only effective way to prevent or decrease tissue damage to the body. <br />Quickly remove any clothing that has liquid sulfur mustard on it. If possible, seal the clothing in a plastic bag, and then seal that bag inside a second plastic bag. <br />Immediately wash any exposed part of the body (eyes, skin, etc.) thoroughly with plain, clean water. Eyes need to be flushed with water for 5 to 10 minutes. Do NOT cover eyes with bandages, but do protect them with dark glasses or goggles. <br />If someone has ingested sulfur mustard, do NOT induce vomiting. Give the person milk to drink. <br />Seek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. <br /><br />How sulfur mustard exposure is treated<br />The most important factor is removing sulfur mustard from the body. Exposure to sulfur mustard is treated by giving the victim supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the exposure. Though no antidote exists for sulfur mustard, exposure is usually not fatal.<br /><br />Where people can get more information about sulfur mustard<br /><br />For more information about sulfur mustard, people can contact the following:<br />Regional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 <br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <br />oPublic Response Hotline (CDC) <br />?800-CDC-INFO <br />?888-232-6348 (TTY) <br />oE-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov <br /><br />This fact sheet is based on CDCs best current information. It may be updated as new information becomes available.<br />", "botulism": "Botulism FactSheet<br /><br />Botulism is a muscle-paralyzing disease caused by a toxin made by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. <br /><br />There are three main kinds of botulism:<br />Foodborne botulism occurs when a person ingests pre-formed toxin that leads to illness within a few hours to days. Foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because the contaminated food may still be available to other persons besides the patient.<br />Infant botulism occurs in a small number of susceptible infants each year who harbor C. botulinum in their intestinal tract.<br />Wound botulism occurs when wounds are infected with C. botulinum that secretes the toxin. <br /><br />With foodborne botulism, symptoms begin within 6 hours to 2 weeks (most commonly between 12 and 36 hours) after eating toxin-containing food. Symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, muscle weakness that always descends through the body: first shoulders are affected, then upper arms, lower arms, thighs, calves, etc. Paralysis of breathing muscles can cause a person to stop breathing and die, unless assistance with breathing (mechanical ventilation) is provided.<br /><br />Botulism is not spread from one person to another. Foodborne botulism can occur in all age groups.<br /><br />A supply of antitoxin against botulism is maintained by CDC. The antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if administered early in the course of the disease. Most patients eventually recover after weeks to months of supportive care. <br /> <br />", "ricin": "Ricin FactSheet<br /><br />What ricin is<br />Ricin is a poison that can be made from the waste left over from processing castor beans. <br />It can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. <br />It is a stable substance. For example, it is not affected much by extreme conditions such as very hot or very cold temperatures. <br /><br />Where ricin is found and how it is used<br />Castor beans are processed throughout the world to make castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste mash produced when castor oil is made. <br />Ricin has some potential medical uses, such as bone marrow transplants and cancer treatment (to kill cancer cells). <br /><br />How you could be exposed to ricin<br />It would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. Accidental exposure to ricin is highly unlikely. <br />People can breathe in ricin mist or powder and be poisoned. <br />Ricin can also get into water or food and then be swallowed. <br />Pellets of ricin, or ricin dissolved in a liquid, can be injected into peoples bodies. <br />Depending on the route of exposure (such as injection or inhalation), as little as 500 micrograms of ricin could be enough to kill an adult. A 500-microgram dose of ricin would be about the size of the head of a pin. A greater amount would likely be needed to kill people if the ricin were swallowed. <br />In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markovs skin. <br />Some reports have indicated that ricin may have been used in the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s and that quantities of ricin were found in Al Qaeda caves in Afghanistan. <br />Ricin poisoning is not contagious. It cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. <br /><br />How ricin works<br />Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a persons body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur. <br />Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. <br /><br />Signs and symptoms of ricin exposure<br />The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. <br />Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours. <br />Inhalation: Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care. <br />Ingestion: If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the persons liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. <br />Skin and eye exposure: Ricin in the powder or mist form can cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. <br />Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received. If death has not occurred in 3 to 5 days, the victim usually recovers. <br />Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to ricin. <br /><br />How ricin poisoning is treated<br />Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the first place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. Ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizure and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.<br /><br />How you can know whether you have been exposed to ricin<br />If we suspect that people have inhaled ricin, a potential clue would be that a large number of people who had been close to each other suddenly developed fever, cough, and excess fluid in their lungs. These symptoms could be followed by severe breathing problems and possibly death. <br />No widely available, reliable test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin. <br /><br />How you can protect yourself, and what to do if you are exposed to ricin<br />First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the ricin was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from exposure to ricin. <br />oIf the ricin release was outside, move away from the area where the ricin was released. <br />oIf the ricin release was indoors, get out of the building. <br />If you are near a release of ricin, emergency coordinators may tell you to either evacuate the area or to shelter in place inside a building to avoid being exposed to the chemical. For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, see Facts About Evacuation. For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, see Facts About Sheltering in Place. <br />If you think you may have been exposed to ricin, you should remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. <br />Removing your clothing: <br />oQuickly take off clothing that may have ricin on it. Any clothing that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off the body instead of pulled over the head. <br />oIf you are helping other people remove their clothing, try to avoid touching any contaminated areas, and remove the clothing as quickly as possible. <br />Washing yourself: <br />oAs quickly as possible, wash any ricin from your skin with large amounts of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will help protect people from any chemicals on their bodies. <br />oIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the contaminated clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. <br />Disposing of your clothes: <br />oAfter you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching contaminated areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching contaminated areas, or you aren't sure where the contaminated areas are, wear rubber gloves, turn the bag inside out and use it to pick up the clothing, or put the clothing in the bag using tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects. Anything that touches the contaminated clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. <br />oSeal the bag, and then seal that bag inside another plastic bag. Disposing of your clothing in this way will help protect you and other people from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. <br />oWhen the local or state health department or emergency personnel arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency personnel will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. <br />For more information about cleaning your body and disposing of your clothes after a chemical release, see Chemical Agents: Facts About Personal Cleaning and Disposal of Contaminated Clothing. <br />If someone has ingested ricin, do not induce vomiting or give fluids to drink. <br />Seek medical attention right away.

An estimated 73,000 cases of infection and 61 deaths occur in the United States each year. Infection often leads to bloody diarrhea, and occasionally to kidney failure. Most illness has been associated with eating undercooked, contaminated ground beef. Person-to-person contact in families and child care centers is also an important mode of transmission. Infection can also occur after drinking raw milk and after swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. <br /><br />Consumers can prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection by thoroughly cooking ground beef, avoiding unpasteurized milk, and washing hands carefully.<br />Because the organism lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, preventive measures on cattle farms and during meat processing are beinginvestigated. <br />________________________________________<br />What is Escherichia coli O157:H7?<br /><br />E. coli O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Although most strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals, this strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness. <br /><br />E. coli O157:H7 was first recognized as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea; the outbreak was traced to contaminated hamburgers. Since then, most infections have come from eating undercooked ground beef. <br /><br />The combination of letters and numbers in the name of the bacterium refers to the specific markers found on its surface and distinguishes it from other types of E. coli. <br />Back to Top <br />How is E. coli O157:H7 spread?<br /><br />The organism can be found on a small number of cattle farms and can live in the intestines of healthy cattle. Meat can become contaminated during slaughter, and organisms can be thoroughly mixed into beef when it is ground. Bacteria present on the cow's udders or on equipment may get into raw milk. <br /><br />Eating meat, especially ground beef, that has not been cooked sufficiently to kill E. coli O157:H7 can cause infection. Contaminated meat looks and smells normal. Although the number of organisms required to cause disease is not known, it is suspected to be very small. <br /><br />Among other known sources of infection are consumption of sprouts, lettuce, salami, unpasteurized milk and juice, and swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. <br />Bacteria in diarrheal stools of infected persons can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or handwashing habits are inadequate.<br />This is particularly likely among toddlers who are not toilet trained. Family members and playmates of these children are at high risk of becoming infected. <br /><br />Young children typically shed the organism in their feces for a week or two after their illness resolves. Older children rarely carry the organism without symptoms. <br />Back to Top <br />What illness does E. coli O157:H7 cause?<br /><br />E. coli O157:H7 infection often causes severe bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps; sometimes the infection causes nonbloody diarrhea or no symptoms. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days. <br /><br />In some persons, particularly children under 5 years of age and the elderly, the infection can also cause a complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. About 2%-7% of infections lead to this complication. In the United States, hemolytic uremic syndrome is the principal cause of acute kidney failure in children, and most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome are caused by E. coli O157:H7. <br />Back to Top <br />How is E. coli O157:H7 infection diagnosed?<br /><br />Infection with E. coli O157:H7 is diagnosed by detecting the bacterium in the stool. Most laboratories that culture stool do not test for E. coli O157:H7, so it is important to request that the stool specimen be tested on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar for this organism. All persons who suddenly have diarrhea with blood should get their stool tested for E. coli O157:H7. <br />Back to Top <br />How is the illness treated?<br /><br />Most persons recover without antibiotics or other specific treatment in 5-10 days. There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease, and it is thought that treatment with some antibiotics may precipitate kidney complications. Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide (Imodium), should also be avoided. <br /><br />Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a life-threatening condition usually treated in an intensive care unit. Blood transfusions and kidney dialysis are often required. With intensive care, the death rate for hemolytic uremic syndrome is 3%-5%. <br />Back to Top <br />What are the long-term consequences of infection?<br /><br />Persons who only have diarrhea usually recover completely. <br /><br />About one-third of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, and the effects of having part of their bowel removed. <br />Back to Top <br />What can be done to prevent the infection?<br /><br />E. coli O157:H7 will continue to be an important public health concern as long as it contaminates meat. Preventive measures may reduce the number of cattle that carry it and the contamination of meat during slaughter and grinding. Research into such prevention measures is just beginning. <br />Back to Top <br />What can you do to prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection?<br /><br />Cook all ground beef and hamburger thoroughly. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria are killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure thorough cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer inserted into several parts of the patty, including the thickest part, reads at least 160 F. Persons who cook ground beef without using a thermometer can decrease their risk of illness by not eating ground beef patties that are still pink in the middle.<br />If you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef product in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may want to ask for a new bun and a clean plate, too.<br />Avoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils with hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw patties. Wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that require further cooking.<br />Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, or cider. Commercial juice with an extended shelf-life that is sold at room temperature (e.g. juice in cardboard boxes, vacuum sealed juice in glass containers) has been pasteurized, although this is generally not indicated on the label. Juice concentrates are also heated sufficiently to kill pathogens. <br />Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, especially those that will not be cooked. Children under 5 years of age, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly should avoid eating alfalfa sprouts until their safety can be assured. Methods to decontaminate alfalfa seeds and sprouts are being investigated. <br /><br />Drink municipal water that has been treated with chlorine or other effective disinfectants.<br />Avoid swallowing lake or pool water while swimming. See more information about this.<br />Make sure that persons with diarrhea, especially children, wash their hands carefully with soap after bowel movements to reduce the risk of spreading infection, and that persons wash hands after changing soiled diapers. Anyone with a diarrheal illness should avoid swimming in public pools or lakes, sharing baths with others, and preparing food for others. <br /><br />For more information about reducing your risk of foodborne illness, visit the US Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service website at:   http://www.fsis.usda.gov or the Partnership for Food Safety Education at: For more advice on cooking ground beef, visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture web site at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/topics/gb.htm<br /> <br />", "lewisite": "Lewisite FactSheet<br /><br />What lewisite is<br />Lewisite is a type of chemical warfare agent. This kind of agent is called a vesicant or blistering agent, because it causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. <br />Lewisite is an oily, colorless liquid in its pure form and can appear amber to black in its impure form. <br />Lewisite has an odor like geraniums. <br />Lewisite contains arsenic, a poisonous element. <br />Lewisite is also known by its military designation, L. <br /><br />Where lewisite is found and how it is used<br />Lewisite was produced in 1918 to be used in World War I, but its production was too late for it to be used in the war. <br />Lewisite has been used only as a chemical warfare agent. It has no medical or other practical use. <br />Lewisite is not found naturally in the environment. <br /><br />How people can be exposed to lewisite<br />Peoples risk for exposure depends on how close they are to the place where the lewisite was released. <br />If lewisite gas is released into the air, people may be exposed through skin contact or eye contact. They may also be exposed by breathing air that contains lewisite. <br />If lewisite liquid is released into water, people may be exposed by drinking water that contains lewisite or by getting the water on their bodies. <br />If lewisite liquid comes into contact with food, people may be exposed by eating the contaminated food. <br />People can be exposed by coming into direct contact with liquid lewisite. <br />Lewisite vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas. <br />Lewisite remains a liquid under a wide range of environmental conditions, from below freezing to very hot temperatures. Therefore, it could last for a long time in the environment. <br /><br />How lewisite works<br />Adverse health effects caused by lewisite depend on the amount people are exposed to, the route of exposure, and the length of time that people are exposed. <br />Lewisite is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. <br />Because it contains arsenic, lewisite has some effects that are similar to arsenic poisoning, including stomach ailments and low blood pressure. <br /><br />Immediate signs and symptoms of lewisite exposure<br />Most information on the health effects of lewisite is based on animal studies. <br />Signs and symptoms occur immediately following a lewisite exposure. Lewisite can have the following effects on specific parts of the body: <br />oSkin: pain and irritation within seconds to minutes, redness within 15 to 30 minutes followed by blister formation within several hours. The blister begins as a small blister in the middle of the red areas and then expands to cover the entire reddened area of skin. The lesions (sores) from lewisite heal much faster than lesions caused by the other blistering agents, sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustards, and the discoloring of the skin that occurs later is much less noticeable. <br />oEyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur on contact. <br />oRespiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough <br />oDigestive tract: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. <br />oCardiovascular: Lewisite shock or low blood pressure may occur <br />Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to lewisite. <br /><br />What the long-term health effects may be<br />Extensive skin burning, as seen with sulfur mustard, is less likely. <br />Extensive breathing in of the vapors may cause chronic respiratory disease. <br />Extensive eye exposure may cause permanent blindness. <br />Unlike sulfur mustard, lewisite is not known to suppress the immune system. <br /><br />How people can protect themselves and what they should do if they are exposed to lewisite<br />Leave the area where the lewisite was released and get to fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing the possibility of death from exposure to lewisite. <br />oIf the lewisite release was outdoors, move away from the area where the lewisite was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because lewisite is heavier than air and will sink to low-lying areas. <br />oIf the lewisite release was indoors, get out of the building. <br />If you think you may have been exposed, remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. <br />Removing and disposing of clothing: <br />oQuickly take off clothing that has liquid lewisite on it. Any clothing that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off the body instead of pulled over the head. If possible, seal the clothing in a plastic bag. Then seal the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag. Removing and sealing the clothing in this way will help protect you and other people from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. <br />oIf you placed your clothes in plastic bags, inform either the local or state health department or emergency personnel upon their arrival. Do not handle the plastic bags. <br />oIf you are helping other people remove their clothing, try to avoid touching any contaminated areas, and remove the clothing as quickly as possible. <br />Washing the body: <br />oAs quickly as possible, wash any liquid lewisite from your skin with large amounts of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will help protect people from any chemicals on their bodies. <br />oIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and place them in the bags with the contaminated clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes. If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put the eyeglasses back on after you wash them. <br />If you have ingested (swallowed) lewisite, do not induce vomiting or drink fluids. <br />Seek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. <br /><br />How lewisite exposure is treated<br />Treatment consists of removing lewisite from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting. An antidote for lewisite is available and is most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure. <br /><br />How people can get more information about lewisite<br /><br />People can contact one of the following:<br />Regional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 <br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <br />oPublic Response Hotline (CDC) <br />?800-CDC-INFO <br />?888-232-6348 (TTY) <br />oE-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov <br /><br />This fact sheet is based on CDCs best current information.

Most persons infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. <br />What sort of germ is Salmonella? <br /><br />The Salmonella germ is actually a group of bacteria that can cause diarrheal illness in humans. They are microscopic living creatures that pass from the feces of people or animals, to other people or other animals. There are many different kinds of Salmonella bacteria. Salmonella serotype Typhimurium and Salmonella serotype Enteritidis are the most common in the United States. Salmonella has been known to cause illness for over 100 years. They were discovered by a American scientist named Salmon, for whom they are named. <br />How can Salmonella infections be diagnosed? <br /><br />Many different kinds of illnesses can cause diarrhea, fever, or abdominal cramps. Determining that Salmonella is the cause of the illness depends on laboratory tests that identify Salmonella in the stools of an infected person. These tests are sometimes not performed unless the laboratory is instructed specifically to look for the organism. Once Salmonella has been identified, further testing can determine its specific type, and which antibiotics could be used to treat it. <br />How can Salmonella infections be treated? <br /><br />Salmonella infections usually resolve in 5-7 days and often do not require treatment unless the patient becomes severely dehydrated or the infection spreads from the intestines. Persons with severe diarrhea may require rehydration, often with intravenous fluids. Antibiotics are not usually necessary unless the infection spreads from the intestines, then it can be treated with ampicillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or ciprofloxacin. Unfortunately, some Salmonella bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, largely as a result of the use of antibiotics to promote the growth of feed animals. <br />Are there long term consequences to a Salmonella infection? <br /><br />Persons with diarrhea usually recover completely, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. A small number of persons who are infected with Salmonella, will go on to develop pains in their joints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urination. This is called Reiter's syndrome. It can last for months or years, and can lead to chronic arthritis which is difficult to treat. Antibiotic treatment does not make a difference in whether or not the person later develops arthritis. <br />How do people catch Salmonella? <br /><br />Salmonella live in the intestinal tracts of humans and other animals, including birds. Salmonella are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Contaminated foods are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk, or eggs, but all foods, including vegetables may become contaminated. Many raw foods of animal origin are frequently contaminated, but fortunately, thorough cooking kills Salmonella. Food may also become contaminated by the unwashed hands of an infected food handler, who forgot to wash his or her hands with soap after using the bathroom. <br /><br />Salmonella may also be found in the feces of some pets, especially those with diarrhea, and people can become infected if they do not wash their hands after contact with these feces. Reptiles are particularly likely to harbor Salmonella and people should always wash their hands immediately after handling a reptile, even if the reptile is healthy. Adults should also be careful that children wash their hands after handling a reptile. <br />What can a person do to prevent this illness? <br /><br />There is no vaccine to prevent salmonellosis. Since foods of animal origin may be contaminated with Salmonella, people should not eat raw or undercooked eggs, poultry, or meat. Raw eggs may be unrecognized in some foods such as homemade hollandaise sauce, caesar and other homemade salad dressings, tiramisu, homemade ice cream, homemade mayonnaise, cookie dough, and frostings. Poultry and meat, including hamburgers, should be well-cooked, not pink in the middle. Persons also should not consume raw or unpasteurized milk or other dairy products. Produce should be thoroughly washed before consuming. <br /><br />Cross-contamination of foods should be avoided. Uncooked meats should be keep separate from produce, cooked foods, and ready-to-eat foods. Hands, cutting boards, counters, knives, and other utensils should be washed thoroughly after handling uncooked foods. Hand should be washed before handling any food, and between handling different food items. <br /><br />People who have salmonellosis should not prepare food or pour water for others until they have been shown to no longer be carrying the Salmonella bacterium. <br /><br />People should wash their hands after contact with animal feces. Since reptiles are particularly likely to have Salmonella, everyone should immediately wash their hands after handling reptiles. Reptiles (including turtles) are not appropriate pets for small children and should not be in the same house as an infant. <br />How common is salmonellosis? <br /><br />Every year, approximately 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States. Because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of infections may be thity or more times greater. Salmonellosis is more common in the summer than winter. <br />Children are the most likely to get salmonellosis. Young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are the most likely to have severe infections. It is estimated that approximately 600 persons die each year with acute salmonellosis. <br />What else can be done to prevent salmonellosis? <br /><br />Some prevention steps occur everyday without you thinking about it. Pasteurization of milk and treating municipal water supplies are highly effective prevention measures that have been in place for many years. In the 1970s, small pet turtles were a common source of salmonellosis in the United States, and in 1975, the sale of small turtles was halted in this country. Improvements in farm animal hygiene, in slaughter plant practices, and in vegetable and fruit harvesting and packing operations may help prevent salmonellosis caused by contaminated foods. Better education of food industry workers in basic food safety and restaurant inspection procedures, may prevent cross-contamination and other food handling errors that can lead to outbreaks. Wider use of pasteurized egg in restaurants, hospitals, and nursing homes is an important prevention measure. In the future, irradiation or other treatments may greatly reduce contamination of raw meat. <br />What is the government doing about salmonellosis? <br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors the frequency of Salmonella infections in the country and assists the local and State Health Departments to investigate outbreaks and devise control measures. CDC also conducts research to better identify specific types of Salmonella. The Food and Drug Administration inspects imported foods, milk pasteurization plants, promotes better food preparation techniques in restaurants and food processing plants, and regulates the sale of turtles. The FDA also regulates the use of specific antibiotics as growth promotants in food animals. The US Department of Agriculture monitors the health of food animals, inspects egg pasteurization plants, and is responsible for the quality of slaughtered and processed meat. The US Environmental Protection Agency regulates and monitors the safety of our drinking water supplies. <br />How can I learn more about this and other public health problems? <br /><br />You can discuss any medical concerns you may have with your doctor or other heath care provider. Your local City or County Health Department can provide more information about this and other public health problems that are occurring in your area. General information about the public health of the nation is published every week in the 'Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report', by the CDC in Atlanta, GA. Epidemiologists in your local and State Health Departments are tracking a number of important public health problems, investigating special problems that arise, and helping to prevent them from occurring in the first place, or from spreading if they do occur. <br />What can I do to prevent salmonellosis? <br /> <br /> <br />Cook poultry, ground beef, and eggs thoroughly before eating. Do not eat or drink foods containing raw eggs, or raw unpasteurized milk.  <br />If you are served undercooked meat, poultry or eggs in a restaurant, don't hesitate to send it back to the kitchen for further cooking.  <br />Wash hands, kitchen work surfaces, and utensils with soap and water immediately after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry. <br />Be particularly careful with foods prepared for infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised.  <br />Wash hands with soap after handling reptiles or birds, or after contact with pet feces.  <br />Avoid direct or even indirect contact between reptiles (turtles, iguanas, other lizards, snakes) and infants or immunocompromised persons.  <br />Don't work with raw poultry or meat, and an infant (e.g., feed, change diaper) at the same time.  <br />Mother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breast-feeding prevents salmonellosis and many other health problems. "}
