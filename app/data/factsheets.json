Foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because the contaminated food may still be available to other persons besides the patient.\n\u2022\tInfant botulism occurs in a small number of susceptible infants each year who harbor C. botulinum in their intestinal tract.\n\u2022\tWound botulism occurs when wounds are infected with C. botulinum that secretes the toxin. \n\nWith foodborne botulism, symptoms begin within 6 hours to 2 weeks (most commonly between 12 and 36 hours) after eating toxin-containing food. Symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, muscle weakness that always descends through the body: first shoulders are affected, then upper arms, lower arms, thighs, calves, etc. Paralysis of breathing muscles can cause a person to stop breathing and die, unless assistance with breathing (mechanical ventilation) is provided.\n\nBotulism is not spread from one person to another. Foodborne botulism can occur in all age groups.\n\nA supply of antitoxin against botulism is maintained by CDC. The antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if administered early in the course of the disease. Most patients eventually recover after weeks to months of supportive care. \n \n", "e. coli": "Escherichia coli FactSheet\n\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 is an emerging cause of foodborne illness. An estimated 73,000 cases of infection and 61 deaths occur in the United States each year. Infection often leads to bloody diarrhea, and occasionally to kidney failure. Most illness has been associated with eating undercooked, contaminated ground beef. Person-to-person contact in families and child care centers is also an important mode of transmission. Infection can also occur after drinking raw milk and after swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. \n\nConsumers can prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection by thoroughly cooking ground beef, avoiding unpasteurized milk, and washing hands carefully.\nBecause the organism lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, preventive measures on cattle farms and during meat processing are beinginvestigated. \n________________________________________\nWhat is Escherichia coli O157:H7?\n\nE. coli O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Although most strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals, this strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness. \n\nE. coli O157:H7 was first recognized as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea; the outbreak was traced to contaminated hamburgers. Since then, most infections have come from eating undercooked ground beef. \n\nThe combination of letters and numbers in the name of the bacterium refers to the specific markers found on its surface and distinguishes it from other types of E. coli. \nBack to Top \nHow is E. coli O157:H7 spread?\n\nThe organism can be found on a small number of cattle farms and can live in the intestines of healthy cattle. Meat can become contaminated during slaughter, and organisms can be thoroughly mixed into beef when it is ground. Bacteria present on the cow's udders or on equipment may get into raw milk. \n\nEating meat, especially ground beef, that has not been cooked sufficiently to kill E. coli O157:H7 can cause infection. Contaminated meat looks and smells normal. Although the number of organisms required to cause disease is not known, it is suspected to be very small. \n\nAmong other known sources of infection are consumption of sprouts, lettuce, salami, unpasteurized milk and juice, and swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. \nBacteria in diarrheal stools of infected persons can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or handwashing habits are inadequate.\nThis is particularly likely among toddlers who are not toilet trained. Family members and playmates of these children are at high risk of becoming infected. \n\nYoung children typically shed the organism in their feces for a week or two after their illness resolves. Older children rarely carry the organism without symptoms. \nBack to Top \nWhat illness does E. coli O157:H7 cause?\n\nE. coli O157:H7 infection often causes severe bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps; sometimes the infection causes nonbloody diarrhea or no symptoms. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days. \n\nIn some persons, particularly children under 5 years of age and the elderly, the infection can also cause a complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. About 2%-7% of infections lead to this complication. In the United States, hemolytic uremic syndrome is the principal cause of acute kidney failure in children, and most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome are caused by E. coli O157:H7. \nBack to Top \nHow is E. coli O157:H7 infection diagnosed?\n\nInfection with E. coli O157:H7 is diagnosed by detecting the bacterium in the stool. Most laboratories that culture stool do not test for E. coli O157:H7, so it is important to request that the stool specimen be tested on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar for this organism. All persons who suddenly have diarrhea with blood should get their stool tested for E. coli O157:H7. \nBack to Top \nHow is the illness treated?\n\nMost persons recover without antibiotics or other specific treatment in 5-10 days. There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease, and it is thought that treatment with some antibiotics may precipitate kidney complications. Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide (Imodium), should also be avoided. \n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome is a life-threatening condition usually treated in an intensive care unit. Blood transfusions and kidney dialysis are often required. With intensive care, the death rate for hemolytic uremic syndrome is 3%-5%. \nBack to Top \nWhat are the long-term consequences of infection?\n\nPersons who only have diarrhea usually recover completely. \n\nAbout one-third of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, and the effects of having part of their bowel removed. \nBack to Top \nWhat can be done to prevent the infection?\n\nE. coli O157:H7 will continue to be an important public health concern as long as it contaminates meat. Preventive measures may reduce the number of cattle that carry it and the contamination of meat during slaughter and grinding. Research into such prevention measures is just beginning. \nBack to Top \nWhat can you do to prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection?\n\nCook all ground beef and hamburger thoroughly. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria are killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure thorough cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer inserted into several parts of the patty, including the thickest part, reads at least 160\u00ba F. Persons who cook ground beef without using a thermometer can decrease their risk of illness by not eating ground beef patties that are still pink in the middle.\nIf you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef product in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may want to ask for a new bun and a clean plate, too.\nAvoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils with hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw patties. Wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that require further cooking.\nDrink only pasteurized milk, juice, or cider. Commercial juice with an extended shelf-life that is sold at room temperature (e.g. juice in cardboard boxes, vacuum sealed juice in glass containers) has been pasteurized, although this is generally not indicated on the label. Juice concentrates are also heated sufficiently to kill pathogens. \nWash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, especially those that will not be cooked. Children under 5 years of age, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly should avoid eating alfalfa sprouts until their safety can be assured. Methods to decontaminate alfalfa seeds and sprouts are being investigated. \n\nDrink municipal water that has been treated with chlorine or other effective disinfectants.\nAvoid swallowing lake or pool water while swimming. See more information about this.\nMake sure that persons with diarrhea, especially children, wash their hands carefully with soap after bowel movements to reduce the risk of spreading infection, and that persons wash hands after changing soiled diapers. Anyone with a diarrheal illness should avoid swimming in public pools or lakes, sharing baths with others, and preparing food for others. \n\nFor more information about reducing your risk of foodborne illness, visit the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service website at:   http://www.fsis.usda.gov or the Partnership for Food Safety Education at: For more advice on cooking ground beef, visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture web site at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/topics/gb.htm\n \n", "lewisite": "Lewisite FactSheet\n\nWhat lewisite is\n\u2022\tLewisite is a type of chemical warfare agent. This kind of agent is called a vesicant or blistering agent, because it causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. \n\u2022\tLewisite is an oily, colorless liquid in its pure form and can appear amber to black in its impure form. \n\u2022\tLewisite has an odor like geraniums. \n\u2022\tLewisite contains arsenic, a poisonous element. \n\u2022\tLewisite is also known by its military designation, \u201cL.\u201d \n\nWhere lewisite is found and how it is used\n\u2022\tLewisite was produced in 1918 to be used in World War I, but its production was too late for it to be used in the war. \n\u2022\tLewisite has been used only as a chemical warfare agent. It has no medical or other practical use. \n\u2022\tLewisite is not found naturally in the environment. \n\nHow people can be exposed to lewisite\n\u2022\tPeople\u2019s risk for exposure depends on how close they are to the place where the lewisite was released. \n\u2022\tIf lewisite gas is released into the air, people may be exposed through skin contact or eye contact. They may also be exposed by breathing air that contains lewisite. \n\u2022\tIf lewisite liquid is released into water, people may be exposed by drinking water that contains lewisite or by getting the water on their bodies. \n\u2022\tIf lewisite liquid comes into contact with food, people may be exposed by eating the contaminated food. \n\u2022\tPeople can be exposed by coming into direct contact with liquid lewisite. \n\u2022\tLewisite vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas. \n\u2022\tLewisite remains a liquid under a wide range of environmental conditions, from below freezing to very hot temperatures. Therefore, it could last for a long time in the environment. \n\nHow lewisite works\n\u2022\tAdverse health effects caused by lewisite depend on the amount people are exposed to, the route of exposure, and the length of time that people are exposed. \n\u2022\tLewisite is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. \n\u2022\tBecause it contains arsenic, lewisite has some effects that are similar to arsenic poisoning, including stomach ailments and low blood pressure. \n\nImmediate signs and symptoms of lewisite exposure\n\u2022\tMost information on the health effects of lewisite is based on animal studies. \n\u2022\tSigns and symptoms occur immediately following a lewisite exposure. Lewisite can have the following effects on specific parts of the body: \no\tSkin: pain and irritation within seconds to minutes, redness within 15 to 30 minutes followed by blister formation within several hours. The blister begins as a small blister in the middle of the red areas and then expands to cover the entire reddened area of skin. The lesions (sores) from lewisite heal much faster than lesions caused by the other blistering agents, sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustards, and the discoloring of the skin that occurs later is much less noticeable. \no\tEyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur on contact. \no\tRespiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough \no\tDigestive tract: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. \no\tCardiovascular: \u201cLewisite shock\u201d or low blood pressure may occur \n\u2022\tShowing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to lewisite. \n\nWhat the long-term health effects may be\n\u2022\tExtensive skin burning, as seen with sulfur mustard, is less likely. \n\u2022\tExtensive breathing in of the vapors may cause chronic respiratory disease. \n\u2022\tExtensive eye exposure may cause permanent blindness. \n\u2022\tUnlike sulfur mustard, lewisite is not known to suppress the immune system. \n\nHow people can protect themselves and what they should do if they are exposed to lewisite\n\u2022\tLeave the area where the lewisite was released and get to fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing the possibility of death from exposure to lewisite. \no\tIf the lewisite release was outdoors, move away from the area where the lewisite was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because lewisite is heavier than air and will sink to low-lying areas. \no\tIf the lewisite release was indoors, get out of the building. \n\u2022\tIf you think you may have been exposed, remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. \n\u2022\tRemoving and disposing of clothing: \no\tQuickly take off clothing that has liquid lewisite on it. Any clothing that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off the body instead of pulled over the head. If possible, seal the clothing in a plastic bag. Then seal the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag. Removing and sealing the clothing in this way will help protect you and other people from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. \no\tIf you placed your clothes in plastic bags, inform either the local or state health department or emergency personnel upon their arrival. Do not handle the plastic bags. \no\tIf you are helping other people remove their clothing, try to avoid touching any contaminated areas, and remove the clothing as quickly as possible. \n\u2022\tWashing the body: \no\tAs quickly as possible, wash any liquid lewisite from your skin with large amounts of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will help protect people from any chemicals on their bodies. \no\tIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and place them in the bags with the contaminated clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes. If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put the eyeglasses back on after you wash them. \n\u2022\tIf you have ingested (swallowed) lewisite, do not induce vomiting or drink fluids. \n\u2022\tSeek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. \n\nHow lewisite exposure is treated\n\u2022\tTreatment consists of removing lewisite from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting. An antidote for lewisite is available and is most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure. \n\nHow people can get more information about lewisite\n\nPeople can contact one of the following:\n\u2022\tRegional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 \n\u2022\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \no\tPublic Response Hotline (CDC) \n?\t800-CDC-INFO \n?\t888-232-6348 (TTY) \no\tE-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov \n\nThis fact sheet is based on CDC\u2019s best current information.

For example, it is not affected much by extreme conditions such as very hot or very cold temperatures. \n\nWhere ricin is found and how it is used\n\u2022\tCastor beans are processed throughout the world to make castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste \u201cmash\u201d produced when castor oil is made. \n\u2022\tRicin has some potential medical uses, such as bone marrow transplants and cancer treatment (to kill cancer cells). \n\nHow you could be exposed to ricin\n\u2022\tIt would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. Accidental exposure to ricin is highly unlikely. \n\u2022\tPeople can breathe in ricin mist or powder and be poisoned. \n\u2022\tRicin can also get into water or food and then be swallowed. \n\u2022\tPellets of ricin, or ricin dissolved in a liquid, can be injected into people\u2019s bodies. \n\u2022\tDepending on the route of exposure (such as injection or inhalation), as little as 500 micrograms of ricin could be enough to kill an adult. A 500-microgram dose of ricin would be about the size of the head of a pin. A greater amount would likely be needed to kill people if the ricin were swallowed. \n\u2022\tIn 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov\u2019s skin. \n\u2022\tSome reports have indicated that ricin may have been used in the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s and that quantities of ricin were found in Al Qaeda caves in Afghanistan. \n\u2022\tRicin poisoning is not contagious. It cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. \n\nHow ricin works\n\u2022\tRicin works by getting inside the cells of a person\u2019s body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur. \n\u2022\tEffects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. \n\nSigns and symptoms of ricin exposure\n\u2022\tThe major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. \n\u2022\tInitial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours. \n\u2022\tInhalation: Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care. \n\u2022\tIngestion: If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person\u2019s liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. \n\u2022\tSkin and eye exposure: Ricin in the powder or mist form can cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. \n\u2022\tDeath from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received. If death has not occurred in 3 to 5 days, the victim usually recovers. \n\u2022\tShowing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to ricin. \n\nHow ricin poisoning is treated\nBecause no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the first place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. Ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizure and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.\n\nHow you can know whether you have been exposed to ricin\n\u2022\tIf we suspect that people have inhaled ricin, a potential clue would be that a large number of people who had been close to each other suddenly developed fever, cough, and excess fluid in their lungs. These symptoms could be followed by severe breathing problems and possibly death. \n\u2022\tNo widely available, reliable test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin. \n\nHow you can protect yourself, and what to do if you are exposed to ricin\n\u2022\tFirst, get fresh air by leaving the area where the ricin was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from exposure to ricin. \no\tIf the ricin release was outside, move away from the area where the ricin was released. \no\tIf the ricin release was indoors, get out of the building. \n\u2022\tIf you are near a release of ricin, emergency coordinators may tell you to either evacuate the area or to \u201cshelter in place\u201d inside a building to avoid being exposed to the chemical. For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, see Facts About Evacuation. For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, see Facts About Sheltering in Place. \n\u2022\tIf you think you may have been exposed to ricin, you should remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. \n\u2022\tRemoving your clothing: \no\tQuickly take off clothing that may have ricin on it. Any clothing that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off the body instead of pulled over the head. \no\tIf you are helping other people remove their clothing, try to avoid touching any contaminated areas, and remove the clothing as quickly as possible. \n\u2022\tWashing yourself: \no\tAs quickly as possible, wash any ricin from your skin with large amounts of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will help protect people from any chemicals on their bodies. \no\tIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the contaminated clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. \n\u2022\tDisposing of your clothes: \no\tAfter you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching contaminated areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching contaminated areas, or you aren't sure where the contaminated areas are, wear rubber gloves, turn the bag inside out and use it to pick up the clothing, or put the clothing in the bag using tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects. Anything that touches the contaminated clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. \no\tSeal the bag, and then seal that bag inside another plastic bag. Disposing of your clothing in this way will help protect you and other people from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. \no\tWhen the local or state health department or emergency personnel arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency personnel will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. \n\u2022\tFor more information about cleaning your body and disposing of your clothes after a chemical release, see Chemical Agents: Facts About Personal Cleaning and Disposal of Contaminated Clothing. \n\u2022\tIf someone has ingested ricin, do not induce vomiting or give fluids to drink. \n\u2022\tSeek medical attention right away.

Most persons infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. \nWhat sort of germ is Salmonella? \n\nThe Salmonella germ is actually a group of bacteria that can cause diarrheal illness in humans. They are microscopic living creatures that pass from the feces of people or animals, to other people or other animals. There are many different kinds of Salmonella bacteria. Salmonella serotype Typhimurium and Salmonella serotype Enteritidis are the most common in the United States. Salmonella has been known to cause illness for over 100 years. They were discovered by a American scientist named Salmon, for whom they are named. \nHow can Salmonella infections be diagnosed? \n\nMany different kinds of illnesses can cause diarrhea, fever, or abdominal cramps. Determining that Salmonella is the cause of the illness depends on laboratory tests that identify Salmonella in the stools of an infected person. These tests are sometimes not performed unless the laboratory is instructed specifically to look for the organism. Once Salmonella has been identified, further testing can determine its specific type, and which antibiotics could be used to treat it. \nHow can Salmonella infections be treated? \n\nSalmonella infections usually resolve in 5-7 days and often do not require treatment unless the patient becomes severely dehydrated or the infection spreads from the intestines. Persons with severe diarrhea may require rehydration, often with intravenous fluids. Antibiotics are not usually necessary unless the infection spreads from the intestines, then it can be treated with ampicillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or ciprofloxacin. Unfortunately, some Salmonella bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, largely as a result of the use of antibiotics to promote the growth of feed animals. \nAre there long term consequences to a Salmonella infection? \n\nPersons with diarrhea usually recover completely, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. A small number of persons who are infected with Salmonella, will go on to develop pains in their joints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urination. This is called Reiter's syndrome. It can last for months or years, and can lead to chronic arthritis which is difficult to treat. Antibiotic treatment does not make a difference in whether or not the person later develops arthritis. \nHow do people catch Salmonella? \n\nSalmonella live in the intestinal tracts of humans and other animals, including birds. Salmonella are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Contaminated foods are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk, or eggs, but all foods, including vegetables may become contaminated. Many raw foods of animal origin are frequently contaminated, but fortunately, thorough cooking kills Salmonella. Food may also become contaminated by the unwashed hands of an infected food handler, who forgot to wash his or her hands with soap after using the bathroom. \n\nSalmonella may also be found in the feces of some pets, especially those with diarrhea, and people can become infected if they do not wash their hands after contact with these feces. Reptiles are particularly likely to harbor Salmonella and people should always wash their hands immediately after handling a reptile, even if the reptile is healthy. Adults should also be careful that children wash their hands after handling a reptile. \nWhat can a person do to prevent this illness? \n\nThere is no vaccine to prevent salmonellosis. Since foods of animal origin may be contaminated with Salmonella, people should not eat raw or undercooked eggs, poultry, or meat. Raw eggs may be unrecognized in some foods such as homemade hollandaise sauce, caesar and other homemade salad dressings, tiramisu, homemade ice cream, homemade mayonnaise, cookie dough, and frostings. Poultry and meat, including hamburgers, should be well-cooked, not pink in the middle. Persons also should not consume raw or unpasteurized milk or other dairy products. Produce should be thoroughly washed before consuming. \n\nCross-contamination of foods should be avoided. Uncooked meats should be keep separate from produce, cooked foods, and ready-to-eat foods. Hands, cutting boards, counters, knives, and other utensils should be washed thoroughly after handling uncooked foods. Hand should be washed before handling any food, and between handling different food items. \n\nPeople who have salmonellosis should not prepare food or pour water for others until they have been shown to no longer be carrying the Salmonella bacterium. \n\nPeople should wash their hands after contact with animal feces. Since reptiles are particularly likely to have Salmonella, everyone should immediately wash their hands after handling reptiles. Reptiles (including turtles) are not appropriate pets for small children and should not be in the same house as an infant. \nHow common is salmonellosis? \n\nEvery year, approximately 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States. Because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of infections may be thity or more times greater. Salmonellosis is more common in the summer than winter. \nChildren are the most likely to get salmonellosis. Young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are the most likely to have severe infections. It is estimated that approximately 600 persons die each year with acute salmonellosis. \nWhat else can be done to prevent salmonellosis? \n\nSome prevention steps occur everyday without you thinking about it. Pasteurization of milk and treating municipal water supplies are highly effective prevention measures that have been in place for many years. In the 1970s, small pet turtles were a common source of salmonellosis in the United States, and in 1975, the sale of small turtles was halted in this country. Improvements in farm animal hygiene, in slaughter plant practices, and in vegetable and fruit harvesting and packing operations may help prevent salmonellosis caused by contaminated foods. Better education of food industry workers in basic food safety and restaurant inspection procedures, may prevent cross-contamination and other food handling errors that can lead to outbreaks. Wider use of pasteurized egg in restaurants, hospitals, and nursing homes is an important prevention measure. In the future, irradiation or other treatments may greatly reduce contamination of raw meat. \nWhat is the government doing about salmonellosis? \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors the frequency of Salmonella infections in the country and assists the local and State Health Departments to investigate outbreaks and devise control measures. CDC also conducts research to better identify specific types of Salmonella. The Food and Drug Administration inspects imported foods, milk pasteurization plants, promotes better food preparation techniques in restaurants and food processing plants, and regulates the sale of turtles. The FDA also regulates the use of specific antibiotics as growth promotants in food animals. The US Department of Agriculture monitors the health of food animals, inspects egg pasteurization plants, and is responsible for the quality of slaughtered and processed meat. The US Environmental Protection Agency regulates and monitors the safety of our drinking water supplies. \nHow can I learn more about this and other public health problems? \n\nYou can discuss any medical concerns you may have with your doctor or other heath care provider. Your local City or County Health Department can provide more information about this and other public health problems that are occurring in your area. General information about the public health of the nation is published every week in the \"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\", by the CDC in Atlanta, GA. Epidemiologists in your local and State Health Departments are tracking a number of important public health problems, investigating special problems that arise, and helping to prevent them from occurring in the first place, or from spreading if they do occur. \nWhat can I do to prevent salmonellosis? \n \n \nCook poultry, ground beef, and eggs thoroughly before eating. Do not eat or drink foods containing raw eggs, or raw unpasteurized milk. \t \nIf you are served undercooked meat, poultry or eggs in a restaurant, don't hesitate to send it back to the kitchen for further cooking. \t \nWash hands, kitchen work surfaces, and utensils with soap and water immediately after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry.\t \nBe particularly careful with foods prepared for infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. \t \nWash hands with soap after handling reptiles or birds, or after contact with pet feces. \t \nAvoid direct or even indirect contact between reptiles (turtles, iguanas, other lizards, snakes) and infants or immunocompromised persons. \t \nDon't work with raw poultry or meat, and an infant (e.g., feed, change diaper) at the same time. \t \nMother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breast-feeding prevents salmonellosis and many other health problems. ", "sulfur mustard": "Sulfur Mustard FactSheet\n\nWhat sulfur mustard is\n\u2022\tSulfur mustard is a type of chemical warfare agent. These kinds of agents are called vesicants or blistering agents, because they cause blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard is also known as \u201cmustard gas or mustard agent,\u201d or by the military designations H, HD, and HT. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard sometimes smells like garlic, onions, or mustard and sometimes has no odor. It can be a vapor (the gaseous form of a liquid), an oily-textured liquid, or a solid. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard can be clear to yellow or brown when it is in liquid or solid form. \n\nWhere sulfur mustard is found and how it is used\n\u2022\tSulfur mustard is not found naturally in the environment. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard was introduced in World War I as a chemical warfare agent. Until recently, it was available for use in the treatment of a skin condition called psoriasis. Currently, it has no medical use. \n\nHow people can be exposed to sulfur mustard\n\u2022\tIf sulfur mustard is released into the air as a vapor, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing. Sulfur mustard vapor can be carried long distances by wind. \n\u2022\tIf sulfur mustard is released into water, people can be exposed by drinking the contaminated water or getting it on their skin. \n\u2022\tPeople can be exposed by coming in contact with liquid sulfur mustard. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard can last from 1 to 2 days in the environment under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard breaks down slowly in the body, so repeated exposure may have a cumulative effect (that is, it can build up in the body). \n\nHow sulfur mustard works\n\u2022\tAdverse health effects caused by sulfur mustard depend on the amount people are exposed to, the route of exposure, and the length of time that people are exposed. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. \n\u2022\tIt damages DNA, a vital component of cells in the body. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas. \n\nImmediate signs and symptoms of sulfur mustard exposure\n\u2022\tExposure to sulfur mustard is usually not fatal. When sulfur mustard was used during World War I, it killed fewer than 5% of the people who were exposed and got medical care. \n\u2022\tPeople may not know right away that they have been exposed, because sulfur mustard often has no smell or has a smell that might not cause alarm. \n\u2022\tTypically, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. Depending on the severity of the exposure, symptoms may not occur for 2 to 24 hours. Some people are more sensitive to sulfur mustard than are other people, and may have symptoms sooner. \n\u2022\tSulfur mustard can have the following effects on specific parts of the body: \no\tSkin: redness and itching of the skin may occur 2 to 48 hours after exposure and change eventually to yellow blistering of the skin. \no\tEyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur within 3 to12 hours of a mild to moderate exposure. A severe exposure may cause symptoms within 1 to 2 hours and may include the symptoms of a mild or moderate exposure plus light sensitivity, severe pain, or blindness (lasting up to 10 days). \no\tRespiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough within 12 to 24 hours of a mild exposure and within 2 to 4 hours of a severe exposure. \no\tDigestive tract: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. \n\u2022\tShowing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to sulfur mustard. \n\nWhat the long-term health effects may be\n\u2022\tExposure to sulfur mustard liquid is more likely to produce second- and third- degree burns and later scarring than is exposure to sulfur mustard vapor. Extensive skin burning can be fatal. \n\u2022\tExtensive breathing in of the vapors can cause chronic respiratory disease, repeated respiratory infections, or death. \n\u2022\tExtensive eye exposure can cause permanent blindness. \n\u2022\tExposure to sulfur mustard may increase a person\u2019s risk for lung and respiratory cancer. \n\nHow people can protect themselves and what they should do if they are exposed to sulfur mustard\n\u2022\tBecause no antidote exists for sulfur mustard exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. Immediately leave the area where the sulfur mustard was released. Try to find higher ground, because sulfur mustard is heavier than air and will settle in low-lying areas. \n\u2022\tIf avoiding sulfur mustard exposure is not possible, rapidly remove the sulfur mustard from the body. Getting the sulfur mustard off as soon as possible after exposure is the only effective way to prevent or decrease tissue damage to the body. \n\u2022\tQuickly remove any clothing that has liquid sulfur mustard on it. If possible, seal the clothing in a plastic bag, and then seal that bag inside a second plastic bag. \n\u2022\tImmediately wash any exposed part of the body (eyes, skin, etc.) thoroughly with plain, clean water. Eyes need to be flushed with water for 5 to 10 minutes. Do NOT cover eyes with bandages, but do protect them with dark glasses or goggles. \n\u2022\tIf someone has ingested sulfur mustard, do NOT induce vomiting. Give the person milk to drink. \n\u2022\tSeek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. \n\nHow sulfur mustard exposure is treated\nThe most important factor is removing sulfur mustard from the body. Exposure to sulfur mustard is treated by giving the victim supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the exposure. Though no antidote exists for sulfur mustard, exposure is usually not fatal.\n\nWhere people can get more information about sulfur mustard\n\nFor more information about sulfur mustard, people can contact the following:\n\u2022\tRegional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 \n\u2022\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \no\tPublic Response Hotline (CDC) \n?\t800-CDC-INFO \n?\t888-232-6348 (TTY) \no\tE-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov \n\nThis fact sheet is based on CDC\u2019s best current information.

The Mad Cow syndrome had consigned\nus to a bleak future.  It was in my junior year in high school that my passage into the adult world\ntook place. I was working part time in the afternoon at a gas station and attending school in the\nmorning. My friend James worked the station in the morning and attended class in the afternoon. We\nalso hung around with a kid named Alan that we nicknamed Squirt. Squirt was taller than either James\nor I, but his whole nature, well, suffice it to say he was Squirt. Squirt was a year younger than us\nand was, I guess, a nerd. But he was likeable, and took no offense at our ribbing. He seemed proud of\nhis new nickname, never having one before. Squirt was hanging out one day after school, when he asked\nJames and I if we had ever been inside a missile silo. Though I was a lifelong Alderwood resident, I\nwas only vaguely aware of the missile silo. James had lived in the town for less than two years, was\ncompletely unaware of the cold war legacy left by Army: an abandoned Nike missle silo in the hills.\nSquirt said he had a maps to the silo and had heard that we could get in there to party. We were\nalways looking for something new to do. James was the only one who had a girlfriend (to be truthful,\nthe only one who had been on a date) but this Friday she would be out of town, so it was agreed Friday\nnight we would go to the missile base and see if we could get inside.\n\nWe made little preparation for the trip to the silo, about a half tank of gas in my old 52 Chevy, and\na few candles to light our way. According to the map, the silo we were going to was about 30 miles\nwest of town in the hills. We thought it best to go after 10p.m. to have less chance of being seen. We\nalso thought secrecy was best, so no one knew what we were about to try.\n\nThe silo had not been in use for a few years and the last thing I could recall was that they had been\n\"salvaged\" or stripped of the equipment and valuable metals. Squirt and I had discussed the issue of\nbreaking in. We had agreed that we would not \"Break in\", but if it was open, as he was told, then we\nwould go.\n\nAbout 10p.m., James and I picked up Squirt and the three of us headed out. It was November and the\ndesert air was very clear and cold. The fall night sky in Washington with no moon can justifiably be\ncalled beautiful. A pure blackness broken only by the stars, many, many stars. It was nearly 11p.m.\nwhen we came to the road that turned north. A car was coming so we had to pass the road and wait\nseveral minutes until the car was out of sight.\n\nThe road to the silo was short and we soon came to a front gate. It was locked securely, but we could\nsee where others had driven to the left and around the front fence. The silo was surrounded by an\neight-foot chain link fence with razor wire on the top. Following the rough road around the fence we\nfound ourselves behind a large mound of dirt, completely blocked from view of anyone passing on the\nroad. This was good, as I had been worried about someone seeing the car.\n\nWe got out of the car and even though there was no moon, we could see fairly well, our eyes adjusting\nquickly to the dark. Slowly walking around the mound of dirt we could see the back fence. There was\nlittle traffic on the highway with only an occasional car passing. When one did happen by, Squirt,\nJames, and I would get very still hoping we wouldn't be seen. After a few minutes of walking along the\nfence we found a breach in the chain link, where someone had cut the fence. It was large enough for us\nto squeeze through. If caught now, we would be trespassing at the very least.\n\nCrossing the distance to the aboveground bunker carefully to avoid various pipes and concrete that\ncould trip us took several more minutes, what with stopping every time a car passed. Other than the\nfence the bunker or entry to the silo was the only thing visible from the road. It stood about nine\nfeet tall, square on the end you entered, and sloping on the opposite side. It was made from concrete\nthat looked to be about nine inches thick. In the darkness it was only a shadow.\n\nThe door to the bunker was broken open. It had been welded shut, but someone had cut the welds. James\nopened the door and one by one we stepped in to the blackness. Nervously James struck a match,\nlighting a candle. A staircase led downward.\n\n\"I don't know about this, guys,\" I said. \"You know we're breaking the law.\"\n\nSquirt remained silent, but James was adamant. \"We've come this far,\" he said. \"No one cares that\nwe're here. No one knows we're here and no one will find out. Hell, they probably wouldn't care if\nthey knew. It's plain someone else has broken in before us, and took their time.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said. \"Let's go.\"\n\nFrom where we were in the entryway we could not see how far the corridor led down. The dim light from\nJames' candle showed a narrow corridor leading down. After a few steps we could see a landing, but\nnothing beyond that.\n\nJames went first, Squirt second, and me following. James went almost gleefully down, while Squirt and\nI followed more slowly. James was the daredevil, always looking for excitement. I think that's why I\nliked him. At the landing we could see at the bottom of some more steps a wall and a right turn in the\ncorridor. We were obviously below ground level at this point, but just so. James led the way around\nseveral corners as Squirt and I lit our candles.\n\n\"Man, it stinks down here,\" said James. About that time the strong musty smell caught us. It was\n getting warmer, too.\n\nJames had moved into what appeared to be a small holding area with steel doors on either end. Squirt,\nnow our resident missile silo expert, said, \"This was a security area. One door was always locked, and\nthe area monitored from below, by closed circuit television.\" After that he kept up a running dialog\nabout the missile bases. I was skeptical that he knew what he was talking about, but I didn't know\nenough to challenge him on it.\n\nWe passed through several more areas on the same level before heading further down the stairs. I\nnoticed that the air was getting heavier, more humid, but we were getting used to the smell. The\nstairs were metal and were showing some rustiness. Two more flights down, we came to a large room. The\ncandlelight flickering past pipes, plumbing, electrical conduits, bare wires, and vents made for lots\nof shadows, making the ceiling, still high above us, seem perilously close. It was clear to us that\nflashlights would have been much better than the candles. The candles were only making the place seem\nmore sinister, like a crypt or mausoleum. It occurred to me that this was more like descending into\nthe world of the Morlocks in The Time Machine than going into a cave.\n\nThe welded-shut blast doors had been reopened by past visitors.\n\nWe took the stairs down another level, passed through a blast door and entered a tunnel made from what\nlooked like a corrugated drain pipe about seven or eight feet in diameter with a narrow concrete path\npoured in the bottom. At the end we found a closed blast door. It did not look to be welded but the\nlatch was closed. Turning the wheel that lifted the latch was not hard but made a horrific screeching\nsound in the quiet of the missile base. The sound echoed from both beyond the door and behind us. We\nstopped and listened for several minutes, I guess expecting someone to catch us and stop us from what\nnow appeared total folly. We were all shivering, but not from temperature. For my part, fear. Squirt,\nundoubtedly fear. James, I think, from anticipation.\n\nThis door did not move so easily. We all had to pull it, a few ear-splitting inches at a time. When we\nentered the next area, thinking it would be the silo, we were met by yet another blast door. It was\nunlatched and wide open. Beyond it all we could see was more of the awful blackness. This area also\nhad the metal grate, and below the grate was water. Unusual in the desert, to have water standing in\nan abandoned building. \"The silo must be in there,\" said James. Thinking back on it now, James\nsuddenly did not seem so anxious to go in, but go in he did, and Squirt and I followed.\n\nNow we were in much larger room. The ceiling was a full 30 feet up, and barely visible in the\nflickering candle light. The massive doors that opened to fire the missile were visible, as were the\nmounts for the gigantic hydraulic cylinders that opened the doors. Everything in here was huge. The\nfar wall was not visible. We stood there silent for a time, then moved to the left. As we walked the\nfloor set into a slight thrumming vibration, just from our movement. As we rounded the silo we found\nthe shaft for a service elevator, marked Level 2.\n\nI wanted to leave, but James and Squirt wanted to find a way to go down. With all the candles held a\ncertain way we could just make out a spiral staircase leading down, on the other side of the silo, on\nthe level just below us. The floors or \"levels\" did not extend across the silo, only extending about\n15 feet into the silo, and going about two-thirds of the way around. The empty space in the silo was\nfor a Nike Anti-Aircraft Missile.\n\n \"How do we get down to the next level, guys?\" asked James.\n \"I don't think we can,\" I said. \"Maybe we should leave and come back later with a ladder or\n something.\"\n \"Let's keep looking. If we can get to the staircase we can go to the bottom,\" said James.\n \"James, there is no way to get down there, if we jumped down to the next level we couldn't get back\n up,\" said Squirt.\n \"I agree, James, there just isn't any way.\"\n \"Look, if we find a way will you guys go with me?\" asked James.\n Confident there was no way, I said \"Sure\" and Squirt also agreed.\n \"Okay, let's look around,\" said James. I went back toward the elevator, James was looking at the silo\n wall, and Squirt was looking down near the right hand side of the blast door....\n\n <<<incomplete document>>>", "map": "Map of Alderwood\n\nNorth to South exits on Route 12:\n\nVarley Wheat and Asparagus\nPrado Cherries and Apples\nUS Government Missile Silo\nBoynton Beef\nBoynton Labs\nPort of Alderwood\nCity of Alderwood\nRodriguez Apples\nKazuhiri Apples and Grapes\nDorfman Asparagus\nGroves Weapons Annex\n", "advertisements": "Advertisements\nDate Published to Web: 8/28/2004\n\nFresh Fruit Farms\nThe freshest produce in Central Washington!\nStop by our stands for locally grown apples, asparagus and exotic Parazuelan fruits!!\n56788 Route 23\n\nKAZ Farms\nIf you like apples, you'll LOVE KAZ!!\n5505 Washington Rd, Alderwood, WA\n\nRodriguez & Sons Apples\n232 Route 23, West of Alderwood, WA\nFamily owned and operated for 50 years.
